C. IF (DUTCH) AUTHORITIES SUSPECT SABOTAGE OPS ORIGINATED (ROTTERDAM),
IN SINGLE INSTANCE POSSIBILITY EXISTS CONVINCE THEN CUBAN EPIGREE
GROUP AND NOT KUBARK INVOLVED, BUT AS SIMILAR ACTIONS CARRIED
OUT IN FUTURE HIGHLY UNLIKELY THEY WOULD ACCEPT THIS PLOY. ALSO,
ALMOST CERTAIN (DUTCH) AUTHORITIES WOULD DRASTICALLY INCREASE SECURITY
IN PORT AREA WHEN CUBAN VESSELS HERE, THUS MAKING FUTURE CONTACT
ANY AMLEGS VERY DIFFICULT. SIMILAR SITUATION MIGHT OBTAIN BELGIAN
AND GERMAN PORTS AS CONSEQUENCE. DUTCH INTEL AND SECURITY SERVICES
HIGHLY AWARE KUBARK KEEN INTEREST DUE TO THEIR HEAVY INVOLVERENI
OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST CUBAN TARGET.

ODYOKE POLICY AND WANTS CLARIFICATION PURPOSE SABOTAGE ACTION.
HE NOT INTERESTED ACTION IF IT PART OF GENERAL HARASSMENT CAMPAIGN
NOT CONNECTED TO MAJOR ODYOKE PLAN OF ACTION. BELIEVE POSSIBLE
HE WOULD BE MORE AMENABLE IF SOME INDICATIONS SUCH A PLAN OCCURRED
PRIOR HIS NEXT VOYAGE.

B. ANLEG 29 APPEARED GENUINELY INTERESTED PERFORMING INTERNAL
SABOTAGE ON SHIP BUT (AS CHIEF ENGINEER VOULD REQUIRE COLLABORATOR

DEFECTION WHICH HE NOT VILLING DO BECAUSE OF MOTHER. IF ANOTHER
ENGINE ROOM ANLEG TRANSFERRED HIS SHIP PRIOR NEXT VOYAGE IN SOLD
