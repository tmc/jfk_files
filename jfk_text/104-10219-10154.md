Dr. Hans KUHOV professor, Univer Ly of Toronto, visited
Moscow from September 1-14, 1975 to undertake research at the USSR:
Academy of Sciences, under the USSR/Canada General Exchange
Agreement. The research was carried out at the Academy of Sciences
Computer Centre, 40 Vavcoha Street. KUMOV's host was Yuriy I.
TORGOV, 2nd in charge of the Computer Centre and on whom a separate
personality sketch is attached.

On September 3 while having a coffee break in the Computer
Centre KUNOV was approached by a man who identified himself as
William MARTIN, an American who defected to the USSR in 1960. MARTIN
openly spoke about his past and stated that he now lives in Moscow
and that he is a consultant to TURGOV's group at the Computer
Centre. He said much of his work is done at home but he does drop
into the Centre weekly.

It was at this time that MARTIN told KUNOV that he would
ike to get out of the USSR even if he has to run certain risks. He
also said that (Bernon) MITCHELL feels the same and has voiced his
desire to the Soviet authorities.

MARTIN asked KUNOV if he might enquire with the Canadian
authorities on his behalf to see what his status would be in this
country or if there was any chance of his being allowed in here as
a political refugee. KUHOV agreed to contact the Canadian Embassy
in Moscow to see what the official view would be and notify MARTIN
at a later date. MARTIN seemed most pleased at this and left KULIOV
his home telephone number, cautioning him not to say anything over
phone that would tip off the Soviet authorities as to his intentions.
This first meeting lasted a little over one half hour and took place
in the coffee lounge area of the Centre. There were other Sovicts
present in the lounge, however, TORGOV was not among them. KUNOV does
not believe the others were aware of their conversation.

On the 5 September 75 KUNOV called at the Canadian Embassy,
Moscow and spoke to a doorman asking him who he might speak to
regarding some Americans living in the USSR who would like to immigrate
to Canada. The doorman referred KUMOV to the office of a Mrs. Louise
O'CONTIOR. KUNOV then spoke to a U/ who stated that he was the
under secretary to irs. O'CONNOR. KUTNOV enquired about the Americans
living in the USSR and asked could they be allowed to immigrate to
Canada. The Embassy official would not commit himself and stated that
KUNOV should enquire officially with the nearest office of Manpower
and Immigration when he returned to Canada. KUINOV did not give this
official MARTEI or MITCHELL's names. KUHOV telephoned MARTIN after
the Embassy visit and stated that the reply from the Embassy was
negative. MARTIN seemed upset that KUNOV should phone him, then he
later stated that it would probably be all right.

MARTIN met KUNOV on at least two occasions after the
5 September, all at the Centre, usually in the coffee lounge and in
the general presence of others. They spoke English at all times.
MARTIN thanked KUMCV for his trouble in enquiring at the Embassy and
cautioned KUNOV not to get personally involved with him in this
venture as it would be bad news. KUICOV promised MARTIN that he would
check with Canadian lanpower and Immigration authorities on the
matter when he returned to Canada

TORGOV and KUINOV spoke in general terms about PARTIN
after the first meeting. TORCOV does not claim to know PARTIN
well. MARTIN has been at the centre for approximately 6 to 3
months assigned to TORCOV's group. Prior to that he worked as a
consultant in another area of the Academy of Sciences. TORGOV
commented that ARTIS does much of his work at home. He said
he felt sorry for MARTIN because he was not accepted by the
Russians in the Academy. He also stated that he felt ARTIN was
a basically honest man.

KUNOV said his motives for trying to assist MARTIN
and MITCHELL are based on huminatarian grounds, only as he feels
they are suffering under the Soviet system. He does not intend.
to take any further action to assist them in leaving the Soviet
Union. KUTNOV hopes to return to the Soviet Union next year for
a more extended period of study.

SECRETY Igoryevich Gov
TURGOV, LCB o June, 1932 Vitebsk, USSR, Head of Lab-
oratory, Computer Centre, Academy of Sciences, Moscow, was a
visiting professor in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada, for four
months
-
November 1974 to February 1975.

A number of sources were impressed by TORGOV's frank-
ness and his willingness to speak out, at social gatherings,
on current problem areas in the Soviet systes. For example
he discussed dissidents in Soviet society and commented on one
occasion that present day Soviet society allowed for far greater
freedom of expression than had been allowed previously. He
said that things were being said in Moscow that one would never
have heard in Stalin's era. Nevertheless, TORGOV argued that
a return to "terror tactics" under Soviet rule was always poss-
ible. He considered that such tactics were unlikely at this
time because of the personal philosophy of Premier Leonid BRESHNEV.

TORGOV is reported to be the son of a scientist and party
member and he himself is an admitted party member. He is married
with three children. He is considered to be one of the top ex-
perts on his field (computers) in the Soviet Union. He mentioned
having travelled to other Western countries two or three times.
His English is good. He was very friendly towards Canadians dur-
ing his visit but it was observed that he did not associate with
three other Soviet research students at the same institution. On
ons occasion in Ottawa he was berated quite severely by a Soviet
Embassy official for his failure to report periodically, as re-
quired, to the Ezbassy. TORGOV later told a source that this Em-
bassy official "could be a dangerous man to your country"..

Re: William Hamilton MARTIN, and
Bernon Ferguson MITCHELL

Purther to your letter of 6 October 1975, we have
identified and spoken to the Canadian professor, Dr. Hans
KUNOV, referred to in your letter as Harry KERNOV. The
attachment outlines the contact between KUNOV and MARTIN
and MITCHELL. KUNOV has proven co-operative as a source
on previous occasions and we believe he will continue to
assist us within limits.

Also attached is a report on Yuriy Igoryevich
TORGOV, KUNOV's host at the USSR Academy of Sciences
Computer Center. In addition to any comments you may
wish to make concerning MARTIN's approaches to KUNOV,
we would welcome an assessment of TORGOV, if available.

The F.B.I. has received the information con-
tained in the attachments.

Yours truly,

E.R.J. Miller,

Dear Harry,
We have learned that on the evening of 8 September 1975,
James WILKINSON of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow had a conversation
of interest with a Canadian Embassy Officer. Wilkinson stated
that while attending a social function at the Australian Embassy,
he engaged Canadian Consular Officer Geoffrey FARRON in conver-
sation. Farrow advised that he had been recently approached by
Dr. Harry KERNOV, an Associate Professor of English at the
University of Toronto in Canada, regarding American defectors
Bernon F. MITCHELL and Willian H. MARTIN. Kernov implied that
he had had recent personal contact with one or both of the
defectors and recommended that the Canadian government give
Martin and Mitchell permission to emigrate to Canada.
furnished no further details regarding Kernov's contact.

Farrow
During the same conversation Farrow asked Wilkinson if he
could supply any basic background material on Mitchell and Martin.
Wilkinson replied that he would pass Farrow's request on to
the Consular Section of the Embassy. Subsequently, Farrow was
given an unclassified article concerning the defectors which
appeared in the June 1961 issue of True magazine.

We would, of course, be interested in any indications that
Martin and Mitchell are attempting to leave the USSR and would
be grateful for any information you may be able to provido us
in regard to the above.

I am using the CAZAB channel in this instance as this
information has been passed to us informally.
