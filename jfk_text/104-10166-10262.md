2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

TO: Director
Federal Bureau of Investigation

FROM: Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: SAUREL, Jean K.
DOB: 17 December 1929
POS: Port au Prince, Haiti
YMAS Haitian

2 FEB 1965

1. Reference is made to the last form regarding Subject who entered the United States on 3 October 1964. The files of this office contain the following pertinent information.

2. According to another office of this Agency, a Pan American Airways employee who spends considerable time in Haiti stated that during his many trips there he learned Subject has demanded and received things from members of the Ton Ton Macoutes (TTM, President DUVALIER's Internal Security Force). One incident occurred at a DUVALIER rally held at the Presidential Palace on 1 May 1964. A palace guard refused to allow Subject to leave the grounds while someone was speaking. SAUREL called a member of the TTM, demanded to be released, and was allowed to leave. On 20 September 1964, a source of unknown reliability, whose family was well ac- quainted with Subject, commented that Subject was a member of the TTM.

3. According to a report received in September 1964 from an untested source, Subject, a former employee of Pan American Airways in Fort-au-Prince who was recently named Director of the Haitian Tourist Bureau in New York, is an agent of President DUVALIER. DUVALIER is counting heavily on SAUREL because of the latter's experience in dealing with American personalities and situations.
