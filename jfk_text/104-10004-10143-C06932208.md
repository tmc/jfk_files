MEMO FOR THE RECORD
1 June 1964.
SX-25605
Discussion betroen MOMBOR SR. Divisiong
and CoS Helsinki CONCERNING timetable
OF OSWALD'S stay in and Holsinki

1. At 0900 this morning I talked with Frank Friberg recently
returned COS Helsinki re Warren Commission inquiry concerning
the timetable of Oswald's stay in Finland in October 1959, including
his contact with the Soviet Consulate there. (Copy of the Commission
letter of 25 May 64 and State Cable of 22 May 64 attached.)

2. Friberg gave me the following information:

a. It takes 25 minutes to drive from the airport to
downtown Helsinki;

b. By taxi, it would take no more than 5 minutes to
reach the Soviet consulate;

C. The Soviet consulate probably closed at 1300 hours local
time on Saturdays in 1959;

d. Passenger lists (manifests) at the U.S. Consulate in
Helsinki are retained for six months only and then are destroyed.
Mr. Robert Fulton (CIA) was U.S. consular official there at
the time.

e. A copy of State's cable inquiry would go to the Helsinki
Station and they would assist in preparation of a reply.

3. Mr. Friberg agreed that it would be worthwhile to cable che
Station concerning points not covered by State in their inquiry. He
suggested changes incorporated into the cable sent to Helsinki.
