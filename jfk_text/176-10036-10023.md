DEFINITE PLANS ARE BEING MADE FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF UNITED NATIONS
TROOPS IN THE CONGO AT THE END OF 1963 DESPITE CONGOLESE PREMIER CYRILLE
ADOULA, S PLEAS TO THE CONTRARY. THE ONLY WAY OF COUNTERACTING THE WITH-
DRAWAL WOULD BE TO FIND A NEW METHOD OF FINANCING THE CONGO OPERATION.
UNDER SUCH A PLAN, THE IDEAL WOULD BE THE MAINTENANCE OF 40-50 PERCENT
STRENGTH. ALTHOUGH THERE IS TALK IN THE UNITED NATIONS SECRETARIAT OF
FUNDING METHODS, THE ABILITY OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL TO ACCEPT SUCH
OUTSIDE FUNDS WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEBATE.
