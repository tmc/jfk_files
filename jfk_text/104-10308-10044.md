Enclosed find an approximate list of expenses that (Armando Munero)
gave me for consideration. However, he would like to talk it over
as to the rest of his stay in the U. S.

(Armando Munero)enclosed a note he asked to have sent over, "La Voz d
las Americas" (onda corta--m ort wave). This is supposed to be some
sort of signal to his O. P. C. group in Cuba to get behind and
cooperate with information and sabotage.-------

-I did not talk to him as yet since I am awaiting word from you as t
this Monday's meetings with him.-----

Jacinto Luzarraga, a friend from Cuba and former sugar mill owner,
and father-in-law of Lino Fernandez (MRR, now in jail at the Isle
Pines), told me that Dr.(Antonio Valdes Rodriguez)(30th of Noviembre
Movimiento) was taken to jail after returning to Cuba from Miami
last time here, and not es yet released. Jacinto arrived here wit
his wife and 3 grandchildren about 5 days ago. He was formerly a
member of the famous old Cuban ABC group. It should be rememb
that Dr. (Valdes received training in S/W, his last trip here.-----

Ben Volpe, now working at Holiday Tours, Biscayne Blvd., Miami, t
me that his father, having come from Cuba a few days ago, told hir
that Federico Claramont, 1100 10th St., Miami Beach(living close
them), is a suspected member of Castro's G-2 and known as such si
being in Cuba. He arrived in the U. S., Miami, as a political ex
which is a cover for his true mission here, and status.------

August 19/61
Jacinto Luzarraga and his relative told me that it is being rumor
that since only men are taken to Opa Locka by Immigration for 48
Fidel Castro is sending in many G-2 women instead of men for his
clandestine operations here, between here and Cuba. I also heard
rumored that some of these agents are sent to tie in with Communi
in the U. S., various regions of the U. S. I have no other info.
this as could not find out more since it was told to me as a runc

Armando Munero told me that he gets information from his uncle
Guillermo Rojas, a long time Cuban Communist who is presently wor
in the Imprenta Nacional at Havana. He helped(supposed to be one

his uncle told him that Kruschev promised Fidel Castro that he
have missles in Cuba(this was a few months ago). Also, his unc.
that the Russians have spies in the Pentagon that pull for Fidel
Castro, and they have already plenty of agents bel nging to the
Communists in all branches of importance of the U. S. Gov't.,
even in the CIA. He said that all people in Cuba that worked vi
the CIA were picked up through their agents and those presently
working with same are being watched closely. (Munerd told me thi
he is kind of suspicious of Eugenio, his being Cuban and because
a sort of sixth sense, as he calls it.-----------

-Bart told me last week that Juez Garceran was the one that sent
letter you received to Carlos Prio as he recognized the handwrit
on both envelopes. The above judge bold Bart that some have bee
given Salvo Conductos to Mexico and that the Italian Embassy is
emptying out same. This judge is the one that made the list of
people held up in the Italian Embassy, that you received from Bar
-Bart told me that he thought that Alberto Del Junco (MDC), that I
in touch, with is getting aid from someone from the U. S. Gov't.
Del Junco's sister saw him this past Friday night at his home and
gave him $5,000.00 in U. S. Dollars(money) to send through the Po
to Cuba to be given to her brother down there. She didn't want t
disclose to Bart where and from whom she received the money, and
only said that it was from his group (HDC) here. Bart thinks that
this is not true. He sent the money down already.
-Enclosed(marked in pencil, #7) find photostatic copies of letters
sent to Oscar Diaz from former F.Castro Pres. Urrutia and from a
Macaroni that Bart kno ws. It is self explanatory in Spanish and
Bart says that he knows that the air strips shown on enclosed map
are truely in existence. Part received these photostatic copies
to his suggesting same to Oscar Diaz upon delivery. I couldn't to
this letter to you a few nights ago as he had to deliver same in
hour of the time I visited him. However, I suggested his trying t
stand by when the letter was opened. Oscar Diaz liked Part's ider
making photostatic copies of same and Bert asked for one for himse

Cont'd. 3.-- It seems that Captain Despain wants to break up the Intell.Servi
of the Frente due to lack of funds, says Dr. F'dez. However, d
having tried to find out whether this Captain Dospain was Ernest
we were not sure. Having been introduced upon our 2nd visit las
Friday, 9:30 A. M. (first visit was 2 days previously at 9:30 A.!
we were presented to. Ernesto Despain, the person we were looking
some time now(due to his relations with Ceferino Alvarez (G-2) en:
Josefina Socarras (Ceferino's girl friend, of whom I have been wri
about for some time now). We started to get places, with all fu
cooperation, the first time there as we spoke only to Dr. F'dez.:
second time, with Despain present, we felt that we should not
many details. Dr. F'dez. told us that Despain was planning on s
him with a delegation to Puerto Rico. I feel, as well as Frank,
this Dr. F'dez.(around 60 yrs. old) is a person that could very e
organize his office to be of very valuable service against Castro
his Communists here in the States, as well as in Latin America wh
they already have their own agents operating. It is felt that De
is trying to get Dr. F'dez. out of the way because he recognizes
importance of the planned Intelligence Service the Frente thro!!
Fidez., Ean which could produce a very strong arm against Castro.

Dr. F'dez. says that they are now working on the ABC form as used
against a former president of Cuba known as Machado. Enclosed is
an idea of how this group functions and are placed into many walks
life of importance to this cause.. Their work is mainly of Intell
Service and in a form of cooperating with the U.S.Gov't. in all we
possible without trying to get monies, if possible, to function. I
presently trying to get donations to $300.00 to keep his office o
for a month. Upstairs in the same building, they have radio operat
(very well experienced) continuously monitoring all phases of impo
ance in Cuba(sugar mills, etc.). Frank asked Despain if the file:
had in his hands was for us. Despain was caught a little off bounds
as he became somewhat unnerved, but soon rallied and opened the fil
showing data on boats, but taking great pains to keep us from seein
the contents. I didn't went to press the point arousing any suspic
Dr. Fidez. introduced me as a Joe Anderson, FBI man. I had formerl
cautioned him against referring to me as anything special, which he

no use to refute him again. However, when we parted, I did menti
him again that he should not do so at random as I did not think i
necessary nor what we had agreed upon. Dr. F'dez. did say so es
introduced us to Despain as his Jefe (chief) and wanted to show hi

loyalty at the same time explaining to him that he was cooperatin
with us in all ways possible against Castro and Communism, which
plainly seen that Despain didn't like at all. Despain sat silent
no questions asked, hard, eyeing us as if waiting to see how far
FBI had gotten into matters of the Frente. I did not ask the Dr.
questions I wanted to and only said that I would like to be in to
with him at all times. Enclosed you will find photostatic copies
letters sent by Cubans here to Prague and the answers of same.. Y
told me to ask him how he got this information. Idid not feel th
should have done so at the moment. However, I will be in touch w
Dr. Fidez. again soon as I said I would. I will not go to the of
of this Intell. again as I was almost seen by a Frank Paez, Pepe
Aguero's friend. Pepe Aguero is Paula Grau's husband, now here.

of more information to give me and that loads of stuff reaches hi
daily, all of which he can turn over to me for study. He said th
will get for me Cia files that the Frente has hidden and want to
with him. I feel, if Despain, is out of the way, I could do much
getting what is needed of them. I do not feel safe with him arou

I promised to return the enclosed photostatic copies but feel thai
of the files can be taken over for copy for the asking, as Dr. Fl
said he would cooperate to the fullest.

Frank Arias has given me the following information About DESPAN).

Captain(Lieutenant, known formerly as) Ernesto Despain, head of t
Frente Intelligence Service at 174 14th Lane, Miami, with entranc
in back of building at 15th Street, off Brickell Ave., worked for
with Ceferino Alvarez (G-2, known as) in Government Insurance(Sem
Gobierno) and formerly in the now non-existent BANSECO (branch of
National Bank of Cuba). Josefina Socarras worked with them also:
Seguro del Gobierno I have written of Josefina before through!
findings of Frank, who knew them all in Cuba(not Despain directly:
only his family). This Captain Despain is an intimate friend of
Ceferino and Josefina(planning to go to New York soon). She has
trying to get something started here, as reported before. It is
strongly urged that this Josefina be surveilled constantly as І,
as well as Frank, think that she is affiliated with Castro's cland
activities here in the States. She received monthly checks from ti
Centro Refugiado Cap tain Despain is planning on going to join t
U. S. Army. He is definitely strongly suspected of giving everyth
of Intelligence to Castro and is tied in with the Communist and Cas
groups here. He may even soon plan to disappear from the scene and
should not be allowed to get off easily. He has been keeping Dr.
Jose Julio Fernandez from organizing his anti-Castro and Anti-Comuni
files due to lack of funds (says Despain). It seems that this was ju
an excuse before and was done to keep the ball functioning as shoul
bę. I think that this Dr. Jose Julio Fernandez is very sincere an
is innocently giving everything into the hands of Despain without
knowing. How Despain got into this position is not known by us yet.

As far as we are concerned he is a Castro penetration into the Frent
and U. S. activities.

The above is the result of being sent to see Dr. Jose Julio Fernande
head of Intelligence Servence of the Frente (as told us by Former
Cuban Grl. Socallanes, friend of Franktx I went with Frank to try t
find out about a woman whose son(one of two of them) had taken data
(MOST)
and pictures for Castro of all military and naval installations in t'
State of Florida.
Cautioned in against referring to me us anything special, which ne

Cont'd.8--- Enclosed find the groups belonging to the Frente that was writte
for me by this Dr. F'dez.
Enclosed find(#8 marked) "Reporte and Informe" (2 sheets) given me
Dr. F'dez. to show what they are doing now.
Dr. D'dez. informed me of the following:
(a). A Communist militant; Alberto Iglesias, 425 Cedar Lane,
Meadow, New York(Phones: IV-1-4368 and IV-6-4547). He is a
Resident of the U. S. for more than 20 years. He has his
business, "American Welding and Boiler Works Co.". This i
man to be watched as he even uses his business as a front.
(b). Mario Garcia, Miami Ventilated Awning Co., Inc.(works at):
presently asking Immigration permission to go to Cuba and
considered as one of Fidel Castro's heads here with a gre
many ties.
Enclosed find a break down of expenses of the Frente Intell. Offi
given me by Dr. F'dez., my asking him for same. Frank Aries is
helping the Dr. get funds for the maintenance of this office for
least another month. I think that this set up should be taken in
study.

August 21/61
Enclosed find marked #9, 2 documents, given me by Emanuel Carvaja
last night which are self-explanatory in Spanish. One is a list
exiles in their Costa Rican Embassy in Havana, and the other is a
cocument(copy) signed and given today to the Minister of Foreim
Relations of Cuba in Havana. It seems that there was very much
discussions concerning some amongst the foreign diplomats in Cuba
The Egyptian Embassador (RAU:Syria, etc.) went to the first meetin
the diplomats had in Habane concerning the new monetary exchanges
He first agreed strongly with the rest and promised to sign the
enclosed type document concerning the new exchange in Cuba.
first meeting was held last Monday, Aug.13th, and they met again

a second time on Thursday in order to sign. He (name not known by
Carvajal) then refused to sign and did not even show up which ind
ted to the remainder of the diplomats that his money must have ber
exchanged in the full amount to keep him off the list of simature
The Swiss Charge D' Affairs informed at the same meeting, to the
Diplomats, that he received information from his Government that t
Swiss Gov't. was checking all present Cuban bank accountants exist
in Switzerland and were readying themselves to act accordingly in
case the Cuban Gov't. should not reach any agreement in regards to
the exchange with the Diplomats.

Contra.
- The Japanese Embassador said he informed his Gov't. about these
difficulties as a protest against the behavior of the Cuban Gov'
This he told at the Diplomatic meeting.

About a week ago, there was a hunger strike at the Brazilian ph
by the exiles there. However, they gave up as a gesture to only
obedience to the Embassador. They protested against not reccivi
salvo conductos and other things.

This coming week, Monday or Tuesday, the Diplomats again are cet
together at a meeting to protest before the Cuban Gov't. about t
lax and Arposeful designing ways of handling this affair, and
remind the Gov't. of their obligations in extending the courtesy
according International agreements.

Carvajal asked me not to mention this, but later said that he
informed us about Embassador Quiros leaving Havana this Thursday
as he was being recalled by the Costa Rican Gov't. for consultati
Carvajal will be in charge of the Embassy for the time, but said
he didn't expect the Embassador to return as he is taking his fa
and house hold items.

He also told me again that Eduardo Odio, Costa Rican Consul in
Havana, was a person not to be trusted by many experiences they h
already had with him.
