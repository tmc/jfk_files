SUBJECT: Mr. Boris D. TARASOFF, PCS Security Clearance

1. I have been advised by a representative of the
Office of Security that Mr. TARASOFF will be granted
security clearance for PCS to Mexico City with the fol-
lowing proviso:

That WHD is aware of and recognizes in conjunction
with his overseas function: Mr. TARASOFF and his
family are known to be CIA; and, further, are known
by USSR representatives whom he served as inter-
preter/translator in the U.S. (NOTE: I believe
that during the periods of the interp./transl.
duties he was given cover of Dept. of State or 99
U.S. Govt. Contract Employee).

2. I advised that the WHD was aware of the above, ace
accepted same, and that the proviso would be brought to
