This document is a memorandum detailing a visit with Julio Pablo RODRIGUEZ Reyes, a Cuban exile who arrived in the US on March 21, 1961. The interview, conducted on April 4, 1961, by Louis H. Rodriguez, revealed that Reyes is a member of the United Revolutionary Movement (URM), a clandestine organization composed of 15 underground groups. Key figures in the URM, including Major Humberto BORIA Faria, Rogelio GONZALEZ ("Tresletero"), and Rafael DIAZ ("Ralph"), have recently been arrested, disorganizing the group. Reyes' sister served as a courier between the URM and the Catholic Chaplain at the Cabana Fortress, with Fray Fabian, the sacristan at the Jesus de Miramar Church, acting as the liaison. Reyes also transported a radio transmitter to anti-Castro guerrillas in the Escambray Mountains and obtained information from prisoners in the Cabana Fortress through priests. He intends to stay in the US and contact "Barreto," the URM representative in Miami. The document concludes that no further contacts with Reyes are anticipated. The US State Department was involved through Frank Waterston.
