This document is a SECRET message, dated November 14, 1977, regarding the US House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations' investigation into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King. The committee, led by G. Robert Blakey, is pursuing leads in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico related to James Earl Ray, who was convicted of King's murder. The committee is interested in Ray's brief stay in Lisbon in May 1968, prior to his apprehension in London in June 1968.

The message indicates that the committee wants to establish a "cordial relationship" with the Portuguese National Police, seeking access to their files and assistance in locating and interviewing potential witnesses. While the Directorate is cooperating with Blakey and the committee by providing access to records (suitably sanitized), they believe that interviewing police and witnesses is best handled by LegAts or others who can be publicly identified. Stations are expected to advise the Embassy if solicited but are requested to avoid involving station officers in negotiations. If unavoidable, HQS should be advised.
