This document is a memorandum from an unnamed agency (likely CIA, given the Deputy Director (Plans) signature) to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding Georges Papanton MITCHELL, Anastasia Martini DAKARJIN, and Espionage. It supplements information from a previous memo dated July 17, 1961, and a letter from the National Security Agency (NSA) regarding Georges Papanton MITCHELL and William Hamilton MARTIN.

The memo focuses on Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU (also known as DAMASCUS, DAMARCON, and RAMASCUS), a Greek national born in Alexandria, Egypt. It details his travel history, including his arrival in Sydney, Australia in 1956 and departure in 1958. It also discusses his sister, Anastasia Georges DAMASCOU (also known as DAMASCUS), and her attempts to obtain a Mexican Tourist Card to visit Nicolas in Mexico City in 1960.

The memo reveals that Nicolas Georges DAMASCOU obtained a U.S. Visa in Mexico City in 1960, stating his intention to visit his sister for pleasure. He is reported to be residing in Los Angeles, California, and planning to marry the daughter of an American official.

The memo also mentions Angelika DAMASCOU nee GAVOURAS, the widowed mother of Nicolas and Anastasia, who was planning to migrate to the United States but suffered a stroke. Aristotle Georges DAMASCOR is mentioned as the father of Nicolas.

The memo suggests checking the indices of the Department of State (Visa Section) and the Immigration and Naturalization Service for further information on the DAMASCOU family's immigration status and whereabouts. It also suggests checking the Department of State for information on Justo SIERRA Casanova, who was mentioned in the previous memo in connection with Nicolas DAMASCOU and his activities during his service at the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C.
