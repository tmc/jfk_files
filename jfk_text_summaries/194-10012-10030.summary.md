This document is a CIA Information Report, dated January 4, 1963, concerning the "Undiminished Prestige of Fidel Castro in Latin America" following the Cuban Missile Crisis. The report, originating from an official British service quoting a Yugoslav journalist who toured Latin America in December 1962, suggests that Fidel Castro retained prestige among his Latin American supporters because the United States did not unseat him during the crisis. The report also notes a growing division within Latin American Communist parties between violent and non-violent factions, leading to more independent policies. The British service commented that the impression of Castro's undiminished prestige did not entirely agree with information from other sources. It also noted that Cuban exiles in Venezuela, including the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) and Alpha 66, were disillusioned but intended to continue small-scale attacks on Cuba.
