This document, "The 201 System," dated November 15, 1974, outlines a method used by the Operations Directorate to identify, control, and file information on individuals of specific interest. The system revolves around assigning a unique "201 Number" to each individual, creating a "201 Dossier" containing biographical information, and generating a "Master 201 Record" for indexing and retrieval purposes.

**Key aspects of the 201 system:**

*   **201 Number:** A unique identifier for each individual.
*   **201 Dossier:** The official file containing information on the individual.
*   **Master 201 Record:** A machine record used for indexing and retrieval.
*   **OI Code:** A two-letter symbol indicating an individual's association with organizations or activities of operational interest.
*   **201 Machine Lists:** Lists of individuals based on names or identifying information.

**Procedures:**

*   Opening a 201 dossier requires coordination with the Information Services Group (ISG).
*   Dossiers are opened on individuals of counterintelligence interest, operational interest to the Operations Directorate, and those for whom operational approvals are requested.
*   The 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is used to open, amend, and manage 201 files.
*   Dossiers contain various types of information, including biographical data, security approvals, and operational reporting.
*   Maintenance of 201 dossiers includes purging outdated or duplicate material.
*   Access to sensitive 201 dossiers can be restricted.
*   Machine listings provide names and 201 numbers based on geographic or functional areas of interest.
