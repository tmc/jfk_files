This document is a SECRET message from the Director of the CIA, dated September 3, 1964, concerning a briefing for President Rivera (of an unspecified nation, likely El Salvador given the "SALV" designator) regarding a Cuban defector. The message indicates that Intel Service Chief Ligibon should also attend the briefing, as he will likely try to take credit for any leads developed. The White House (WH) comment confirms that "SALV" will arrange the briefing for President Rivera to be given by officers on information regarding the "Cuban Defector."
