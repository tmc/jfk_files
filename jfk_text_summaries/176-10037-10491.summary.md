**Summary:**

This document is a CIA information report, dated January 24, 1962, concerning an appeal to President John F. Kennedy from a group of South Vietnamese rebel officers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The officers, led by Colonel Nguyen Chanh Thai and including Major Pham Van Lieu, were in protective custody of the Cambodian government. They sent a proposal to President Kennedy, via the US Embassy in Phnom Penh, outlining their complaints against the Diem government's corruption and ineffectiveness in fighting the Vietnamese Communists (VC). They requested that Kennedy reappraise US policy toward Diem and replace his government with one more representative of the South Vietnamese people. Major Lieu indicated that the group expected to be released from custody soon with Prince Sihanouk's approval and were considering joining the South Vietnam Liberation Organization. They planned to fight Diem before the VC and hoped for asylum in the United States.
