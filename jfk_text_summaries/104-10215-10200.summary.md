This document is a SECRET outgoing SW message dated January 21, 1963, prepared for AMLASH/1. The message, written in Spanish, is from "Jaime" to "Querido Co. Moj 1."

**Summary:**

The message expresses concern that AMLASH/1 did not include a secure return address as promised in Paris. It inquires about AMLASH/1's current position, possibility of returning to military service, and future plans, including whether he is still in Fajardo Hospital. Jaime requests more detailed information on various topics, including a guerrilla training camp (location, names, how information was obtained). Jaime asks if AMLASH/1 can travel to Mexico or another country for a meeting and requests details about three hiding places discussed in Paris.

The message also contains specific intelligence requests:

*   Do the Soviets have their own medical clinics in Cuba?
*   Can AMLASH/1 confirm reports of a large number of Soviets becoming ill in Cuba, including the nature of the illness, hospitalization details, and whether those affected were civilians, military, or both?
*   Can AMLASH/1 confirm shipments of bad meat from the Soviet Union to Cuba, including the cause and quantity?
*   Can AMLASH/1 confirm reports of an epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease in Cuban cattle, including the number of infected cattle, origin of the disease, affected areas, control measures, and whether infected meat is being sold to the public?

Jaime emphasizes the importance of a return address, details about hiding places, and AMLASH/1's future plans. He states that if AMLASH/1 does not wish to continue working together, he should inform Jaime. Jaime stresses the need for frequent and continuous reporting to achieve their mutual objectives for a free Cuba.
