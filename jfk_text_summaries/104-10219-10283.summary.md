**Conclusions and Requests:**

The CIA is investigating the potential connections between DAMASCUS, SIERRA, and KAZANTSEV, particularly in light of the escape route used by the two NSA defectors (transiting Mexico and presumably Cuba en route to the USSR). The CIA requests the FBI to provide any information they have on the relationships between these individuals, SIERRA's contacts with the CASTRO government, and SIERRA's continued contacts with KAZANTSEV or other suspect Soviet officials. The CIA suspects KAZANTSEV is a KGB officer.
