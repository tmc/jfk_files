**Summary:**

This document details a classified operation involving "VASLOUCH-2" at Mexico City's airport. VASLOUCH-2 was attempting to move a doctor's bag and other parcels through customs, but encountered significant resistance from Mexican customs officials. The parcels were thoroughly inspected, and VASLOUCH-2 was unable to secure their release despite assistance from a Station Officer and attempts to influence customs officials. The parcels were returned to air cargo storage, and the local embassy will attempt to obtain free entry. VASLOUCH-1 will travel to Mexico to recover them. There is concern that the doctor's bag may have been tampered with. VASLOUCH-2's departure plans are uncertain due to flight delays. The station will not have access to the doctor's bag until VASLOUCH-1 arrives. There is concern that RS-48 will be held if it is still in the doctor's cases for several years.
