Summary of the document:

This document is a dispatch dated December 19, 1961, detailing a report from an APOT (asset of potential operational use) source, Eduardo NUNEZ Garcia. NUNEZ reported encountering Corror GOLGATA, a colleague of Dr. Aureliano SAN ROMAN, at the New Orleans Airport. GOLGATA stated he was returning from a trip to Panama and Guatemala. In Panama, he had tried to create GITAN but found nobody to cooperate. He spoke with President IDIGORAS in Guatemala, who seemed very anxious to have CASTRO eliminated. GOLGATA expressed his opinion that President CHIARI was cowardly.

GOLGATA also said that he had been contacted by Dr. Ob Hurwitch, Chief of the Cuban Desk in the State Department, who told him not to associate with SEZ or Julio GALECANO, as the man who had the support of the U.S. was AMI-L. Hurwitch, knowing of GOLGATA's work, did not want him to waste time.

NUNEZ added that a few days later, GOLGATA received a phone call from A-1. TEINA told GOLGATA that he would help because it was requested, but he would never have done so by his own wish. GOLGATA continued his travel to Washington D.C., where he resides at 1419-27th Street, N.W.
