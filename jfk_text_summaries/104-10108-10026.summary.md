Summary:

A request for a photo of "bums in police custody at the scene of the assassination" is being investigated. The photo lacks a credit, preventing direct acquisition from the wire service. Mr. Collis suggested contacting Newsweek through "one umak in New York" (who has "State, color"). Herb Simmons (CRS Document Services Group) stated he cannot request a domestic photo without Dr. Proctor's authorization and does not recommend this route due to the lack of a plausible reason for a "State" person to request the photo. Salked spoke to Jim Lolis, Deputy Chief, Ground Photo Services Branch, in the absence of Harry Dan Tuyl.

People:

*   Jim Lolis
*   Harry Dan Tuyl

*   one umak in New York

Organizations:

*   DCI
*   Ground Photo Services Branch
*   CRS Document Services Group
*   Newsweek

Conclusions:

*   Obtaining the photo is proving difficult due to the lack of a credit and the potential impropriety of a "State" person requesting it.
