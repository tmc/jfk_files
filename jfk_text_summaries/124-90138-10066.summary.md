This FBI document, dated December 2, 1959, concerns Paul Hickman and information related to the Communist Party in Cuba. The memo, from S.J. Papich to F.A. Frohboese, relays information provided by Mrs. Jane Roman of the CIA. According to the CIA, Swiss police located Hickman in Zurich, Switzerland, and he was allegedly involved in arms sales to the Castro Government. A CIA representative interviewed Hickman on November 27-28, 1959, and characterized him as a confidence operator and unreliable. Hickman claimed to have volunteered information about Cuba to "friends of Senator Smathers" and had contacted a Soviet Embassy representative in Bern, Switzerland, regarding a Cuban sugar sale to Russia. The Soviet representative initially encouraged the deal but later called it off. The CIA does not plan to monitor Hickman's activities without a specific request from the FBI. The information is being directed to the Nationalities Intelligence Section.
