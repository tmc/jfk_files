This document is a report from the FBI's Miami office to the Director of the FBI, dated July 10, 1967, concerning JORGE RAUL ROBLEJO LORIE and his activities related to internal security and Cuba. The report discusses ROBLEJO's involvement with the COMITE PRO-LIBERACION DE LOS CIEN (CPLLC) (COMMITTEE FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE ONE HUNDRED), an organization focused on the release of Cuban political prisoners.

SERGIO OSWALDO BETANCOURT COLLAZO, a former member of the 30th of November anti-Castro organization in Cuba, provided information to the FBI. BETANCOURT met ROBLEJO in January 1967 and later accompanied him to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where they met with MANOLO RAY and RUFO LOPEZ FRESQUET to discuss their potential involvement in seeking the release of Cuban political prisoners.

BETANCOURT became suspicious of ROBLEJO, considering him "leftist-socialist" and anti-United States. ROBLEJO questioned BETANCOURT about his work as a security guard at the Miami Airport, where Cuban refugees are processed, and inquired about the FBI's activities there, specifically asking if BETANCOURT could photograph documents or people investigated by the FBI. ROBLEJO offered BETANCOURT money for this purpose.

ROBLEJO planned to travel to Venezuela, Panama, and Ottawa, Canada, and expressed interest in obtaining a Mexican visa to potentially speak with FIDEL CASTRO or other Cuban communist leaders about the release of political prisoners.

The FBI planned to monitor ROBLEJO's bank accounts and requested authority to contact BETANCOURT for further information if ROBLEJO pursued the matter of photographing documents. The Bureau will be kept advised.
