The request indicates that Maheu may be employed by the King of Jordan to handle Jordanian public relations in the U.S. Maheu is aware of U.S. government and CIA interest in him. J. O'Connell indicated that sufficient Security Office investigation has already taken place. Field traces were not initiated because Maheu has not been in the area. RI and Division traces were non-derogatory.
