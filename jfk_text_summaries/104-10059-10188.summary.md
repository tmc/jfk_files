**Summary:**

This memorandum, dated July 29, 1968, discusses concerns regarding the information provided by Nosenko in relation to the OSWALD case. Kes. Rocca (C/CI/RTA) highlights gaps and inconsistencies in Nosenko's account. Specifically, the memo focuses on IRINA SHURAKOVA, who had contact with a British-controlled source in the U.K. Rocca believes the Soviets may be trying to portray SHURAKOVA as "clean," potentially contradicting Nosenko's thesis. The memo mentions a visit by SHURAKOVA and the British source to Tussaud's Wax Museum, where SHURAKOVA reportedly had a visible reaction to the OSWALD display, suggesting a possible connection or suspicion. The memo questions whether this reaction was genuine or a deliberate act by the British source.
