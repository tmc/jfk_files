This document summarizes a meeting on November 11, 1993, between the COS (Chief of Station) and Leonid Ryabchenya, Deputy Director of the Foreign Liaison Department of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVRR). The meeting covered several topics:

*   **Documents Passed:** Ryabchenya provided translations of a letter to the DCI (Director of Central Intelligence) from Primakov regarding the Middle East peace process, a paper on aid to Bosnian Muslims, and a paper on the situation in Somalia.
*   **Oleg Nechiporenko:** Ryabchenya addressed the upcoming publication of Oleg Nechiporenko's book, "Passport to Assassination," concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's alleged involvement in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Ryabchenya emphasized that the SVRR had no connection to the book or Nechiporenko's planned U.S. book tour.
*   **Yugoslavia Exchange:** Ryabchenya inquired about the scheduling of the next exchange on Yugoslavia, tentatively planned for December 1993 in Washington.
*   **Environmental Task Force (ETF) Paper:** Ryabchenya requested a copy of the unclassified paper presenting the findings of U.S. scientists involved in the Environmental Task Force effort, promised during the ETF team's visit in July and reiterated by the DCI during a meeting with SVRR leadership on August 9. The SVRR intends to use the paper to facilitate an exchange of views between U.S. and Russian scientists, motivated by the upcoming Gore/Chernomyrdin meetings in Moscow.
