This document discusses an incident in Moscow on December 18, 1963, where approximately 500 African students protested at the Ghana Embassy and marched to the Kremlin. The protest was triggered by the alleged killing of a Ghanaian student, Asaro Addeo, with students carrying placards accusing the Soviets of racism and comparing Moscow to Alabama. Soviet officials claimed Addeo died of exposure while intoxicated, but students believed he was killed for wanting to marry a Russian woman.

The document outlines a plan to exploit the incident through FBIS sources, highlighting it as evidence of racist attitudes in the Soviet Union and linking it to the recent expulsion of Soviet diplomats from the Congo. The goal is to portray the Soviet Union's long-range plan to deceive and potentially take over naive African states through subversion, student indoctrination, economic aid with political strings, and control.
