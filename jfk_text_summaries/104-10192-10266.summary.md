This document is a classified message from JMWAVE to the Director of the CIA, dated May 27, 1962, regarding an article in the Miami Herald by James Buchanan. The article claims that Manuel Ray has replaced Miro Cardona as the leader of Cuban exiles, with the backing of the United States, specifically mentioning support from Con Mooz Marin, President Rolilo Betancourt, and former President Offighedas. The article also alleges that Adolf Berle, a special assistant to the State Department and member of President Kennedy's special task force on Latin America, is running the new U.S.-sponsored Cuban effort.

The message expresses concern about the article's impact on the Cuban exile community in Miami and the potential need to discredit Buchanan's story and reassure Miro Cardona. William S. Wiralda is quoted as saying Buchanan has a reputation for being inaccurate and sensationalist. AMCLATTER-1 and PASS OV ALTER-1 are attempting to trace Buchanan's source for the claim of "U.S. blessing." The message also notes Buchanan's previous attacks on Miro Cardona.
