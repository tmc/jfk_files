**Conclusions and Recommendations:**

*   The CIA's autonomy is problematic and stems from an inadequate doctrine of clandestine operations, an inadequate conception of the relationship between operations and policy, and an inadequate conception of the relationship between operations and intelligence.
*   Clandestine activities should be assessed in the context of their relationship to an open society and to U.S. foreign policy.
*   CIA operations have not been held effectively subordinate to U.S. foreign policy.
*   The Controlled American Source (CAS) program represents an encroachment on policy-making functions.
*   Paramilitary warfare is primarily a political weapon and must be subjected to close political oversight.
*   The British intelligence system, with its strong Foreign Office control, could serve as a model.
*   The relationship between operations and intelligence raises perplexing questions, and the research and estimate function should be fairly independent.
*   The memorandum proposes a reorganization of the intelligence setup, with the State Department granted general clearance authority over all clandestine activity, a Joint Intelligence Board, a reconstituted operating branch of the CIA (National Information Service), and a second semi-independent agency (Foreign Research Agency) responsible for collation and interpretation.
*   The State Department needs a drastic overhaul to effectively command the situation.
