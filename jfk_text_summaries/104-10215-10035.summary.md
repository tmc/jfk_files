This document, dated February 23, 1963, is a report labeled "MRSAVE" with "CONTROLLED DISSEM" classification, originating from "ASSET" source "Faras. 1-1," described as a former Panamanian Charge in Habana, now in Paris. Faras was approached by men working with the Affairs Commission and is said to be successful in shipping medicines to Cuba, including shipments to prisoners.

The report also mentions "Faras. 5 and 6" obtaining information around September 20 addressed to Line of Miami, who is related to a friend of an unnamed individual.

Attached to the report are several items:

*   Bulletin No. 2 of the National Medical Station in the Frente Interna Anti-Comunista (date believed to be June or July 1962).
*   A letter signed by Cmdte Rene A of the Executive Council of the National Inst. of Surgery of the Ministry of Health, dated June 6, addressed to Regino BOTTI, President of JUCEPLAN, requesting $20,000 for raw color film from Czechoslovakia for use in national Universities and Cuban scientific institutions.
