**Conclusions:**

*   Project KDFACTOR was terminated due to a security breach where the VWBLANKET principal knew too much about the operation.
*   The termination of agents was accomplished without immediate difficulties, but future security depends on their silence.
*   The project overspent its budget due to higher-than-expected termination costs, requiring additional funding approval.
*   The project provided valuable intelligence on the Soviet Embassy, including license plate numbers and personnel identification.
*   The risk of damage to US-Mexican relations due to the project's exposure is considered acceptable due to the compatible nature of the operations.
*   The document requests approval for the additional funding needed to cover the termination costs and the formal termination of the project.
*   The document discusses the potential razing and rebuilding of a basehouse used in the operation, with considerations for security and proprietary handling.
