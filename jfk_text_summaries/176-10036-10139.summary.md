**Summary:**

This document is a CIA Information Report dated October 15, 1963, concerning a recommendation by cabinet officers in South Vietnam that Ngo Dinh Nhu be made Prime Minister. The report, based on information from Nguyen Hoang Cuong, Executive Secretary of the National Economic Council, states that Vice President Nguyen Ngoc Tho told Cuong that cabinet officers decided to recommend Nhu's appointment to President Diem. The reasoning was that if Diem didn't intend to reduce Nhu's influence, making him Prime Minister would at least make him accountable. A constitutional amendment would be required, but it was believed the National Assembly would approve it.
