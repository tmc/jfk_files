This document is a memorandum from Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to President John F. Kennedy, dated June 10, 1961, regarding the reorganization of the CIA.

**Key Points:**

*   **CIA's Subordination to Foreign Policy:** Schlesinger argues that CIA operations are not effectively subordinate to U.S. foreign policy.
*   **Clandestine Intelligence Collection:** He points out that clandestine intelligence collection, by charter, is free from State Department control, leading to potential embarrassments and friction with friendly states. He cites the Singapore case as an example. Mentions similar treaties in Pakistan and Japan.
*   **State Department's Role:** Schlesinger criticizes the system where the State Department is informed of covert operations too late to affect their conception and planning. He mentions Tom Mann's remark about the Cuba decision.
*   **Controlled American Source (CAS):** He highlights the encroachment of the CIA on policy-making functions through the Controlled American Source (CAS) program, where CIA personnel operate under State Department cover. He provides examples from the American Embassy in Vienna and Chile.
*   **Paramilitary Warfare:** Schlesinger argues that paramilitary warfare should not be regarded as a purely technical matter and is heavily dependent on the political context. He emphasizes the moral and political price of direct paramilitary failure.

*   The CAS program needs to be reviewed and potentially reduced.
*   Paramilitary warfare is a political matter and should be approached with caution.
