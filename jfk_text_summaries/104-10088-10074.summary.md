This document, "The 201 System," dated November 15, 1974, details the procedures for identifying, controlling, and filing information on persons of interest to the Operations Directorate of the CIA. It outlines the 201 system, which uses a unique 201 number to identify individuals and manage their dossiers.

**Key aspects of the 201 system:**

*   **201 Number:** A unique identifier assigned to each individual of interest.
*   **201 Dossier:** The official file containing biographical information, assessments, and other relevant data on the individual.
*   **Master 201 Record:** A machine record generated upon opening a 201 file, used for indexing and retrieval.
*   **Main Index Master 201 Reference:** A reference printed in reply to an inquiry.

**Dossier Contents:**

The dossier includes various materials, such as:

*   201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831)
*   Biographic information (photos, fingerprints, handwriting samples)
*   Personal Record Questionnaires
*   Operational and security approvals
*   Name check replies
*   Contracts and termination papers

**Dossier Maintenance:**

The document describes procedures for purging and maintaining 201 dossiers, including:

*   Removing duplicate material, obsolete forms, and superseded documents.

**Dossier Charges and Restrictions:**

*   Dossiers can be kept on permanent charge at a desk during periods of active interest.
*   Access to sensitive dossiers can be restricted by holding the file at the desk or placing it on restriction in Central Files.

**Information Requests:**

*   The Automated Index Section (IP/AIS) provides the identity of a 201 subject unless the file is restricted.

**201 Dossier Cancellation:**

*   A Records Officer can authorize the cancellation of a 201 file after coordination.

**Machine Listings:**

*   Machine listings provide names and 201 numbers based on geographic or functional areas of interest.
