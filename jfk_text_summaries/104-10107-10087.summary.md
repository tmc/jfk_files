This document is a memorandum for the record dated March 4, 1969, from Lawrence R. Houston, General Counsel, regarding a 1955 memorandum referring to "T." and "H." The memo discusses an attempt to identify "T." and "H." with George Carey. Carey identified "T." as Juan Trippe and "H." as General Hardin, an Air Force General placed with Pan Am for operational reasons, primarily technical information collection. This was confirmed independently by Mrs. Lovejoy and Mr. Larocque. The Air Force Register lists a General Thomas O. Hardin, who retired in 1955 and became an airline executive. Carey had no knowledge of the Herbert Itkin case, and it was determined that General Hardin is not synonymous with Philip Harbin.
