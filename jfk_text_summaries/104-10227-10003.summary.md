This document summarizes a methodology used to analyze a portion of a tape from June 11, 1962, involving a person named Nosenko. The analysis focused on previous transcriptions that quoted Nosenko as saying he had "also been in the States" and used the alias Nikolayev "both in England and 'u vas' i.e., in the United States."

To resolve the discrepancy, the tape was given to three professional transcribers who are native Russian speakers. Two transcribers, Mr. Kozlov and Mr. Berest, produced a transcription that did not include Nosenko saying he had been in the United States. Instead, they transcribed the sentence about the alias Nikolayev as "both in England and 'u nas'", meaning "in the Soviet Union."

A third transcriber, who was given no prior information, independently arrived at the same conclusion, transcribing the alias sentence as "both in England and 'u nas'", meaning "in the Soviet Union."

The conclusion is that Nosenko stated he used the alias Nikolayev in England and the Soviet Union, not the United States.
