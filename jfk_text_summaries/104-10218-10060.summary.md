This document is a SECRET message from the DIRECTOR of an unnamed organization to BRUSSELS and THE HAGUE, concerning NIKOLAY STEPANOVICH LEONOV, a KGB officer and Second Secretary (Press Attache) at SOVEMB (Soviet Embassy) in Mexico City.

**People:**

*   NIKOLAY STEPANOVICH LEONOV: KGB officer, Second Secretary (Press Attache) at SOVEMB Mexico City. Accompanied by his daughter Irina.
*   IRINA: Daughter of Nikolay Stepanovich Leonov.

**Organizations:**

*   KGB: Soviet intelligence agency.
*   SOVEMB: Soviet Embassy.
*   SABENA: Airline.
*   KLM: Airline.
*   AEROFLOT: Soviet airline.

**Nations:**

*   Mexico
*   Belgium
*   Netherlands
*   Soviet Union

**Events:**

*   Leonov was scheduled to depart Mexico City on June 29 via SABENA flight 556 for Brussels, reportedly en route to Moscow for a 20-day temporary duty assignment (TDY).
*   There was a second report that Leonov planned to take KLM flight 684 from Mexico City to Amsterdam on June 29, which was apparently in error.

**Conclusions:**

*   The message requests confirmation of Leonov's arrival in Brussels and his subsequent departure, presumably on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow.
*   If Brussels cannot confirm the information in paragraph one, the second report about KLM flight 684 should be checked.
*   Liaison may be used.
