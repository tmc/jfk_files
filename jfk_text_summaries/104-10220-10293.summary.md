Summary of the document:

This is a secret dispatch, UFGA-1739, dated June 23, 1961, from the Chief of Base, JHWAVE, to the Chief, WRD, with information for Rosco. The subject is the transmittal of letters sent to Lucas Moran, a representative of the Movimiento Democrata Cristiano (Christian Democratic Movement) in Cuba. The letters, written by Jose Ignacio RASCO and Rafael AGUIRRE, concern RASCO's connection with the HDC (likely referring to the same Movimiento Democrata Cristiano). AMULLA-1 obtained the letters for duplication, having been tasked with getting them into Cuba via the diplomatic pouch of the Italian Embassy. The dispatch includes photostatic copies of the two letters.
