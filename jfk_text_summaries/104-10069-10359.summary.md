This document is a CIA record from December 27, 1962, regarding the current address of Maurice Halperin.

**Summary:**

A CIA source informed the agency that they received a Christmas card from Maurice Halperin with a return address in Havana, Cuba: "Apt C-2, Calle 12, no 103, Miramar, Habana, Cuba." The source and Halperin have exchanged Christmas cards for years, but this is the first with a Cuban address. The source last saw Halperin in Moscow during August-September 1961 when the source was visiting the USSR as part of a US delegation. The CIA is sharing this information due to Halperin's "past activities and associations," and the source's comment that Halperin "always seems to show up wherever there is some sort of activity going on."
