**Summary:**

This document is a debriefing report on AMFAUNA-14, a KUBARK asset, following her detention and interrogation by the DSE (likely the Cuban Directorate of State Security) in Havana, Cuba, from November 22 to December 2, 1963. AMFAUNA-14 was arrested after receiving a letter from AMFAUNA-1, suspected of containing a secret message. During her four-day detention, she was interrogated by DSE officers, including Francisco ABAD, "Carlos" (possibly Samuel RODILES Plana), and Jose Antonio FERNANDEZ Menert. The DSE was interested in AMFAUNA-14's connections to AMFAUNA-1 (identified as "Julio"), Luis Braulio VILLAR Negret, Angel BRINGAS, and the AMCOG family. AMFAUNA-14 attempted to protect AMCOG-2 by providing a cover story. The DSE seemed particularly interested in the sources of funds for NEGRET and "Julio," as well as a radio and camera. The DSE attempted to recruit AMFAUNA-14, and she wrote three SW (secret writing) messages under their control.
