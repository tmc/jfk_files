This document is a memorandum from James P. O'CONNOR, Chief of TSD/Security, to the Security Staff of the Office of Logistics, dated March 21, 1960, regarding the Identi-kit SO 9-527.

**Summary:**

The memorandum addresses concerns about an article in "Science and Mechanics" magazine that suggests U.S. Intelligence underwrote the development of the Identi-kit. The TSD (Technical Services Division) has invested $82,531 in the Identi-kit under the EAPWORT Program. Chief Hugh C. MCDONALD, a TSD consultant, was briefed by Mr. ANDERSON (TSD/EB) and his visit to Washington and Honolulu was sponsored by the Agency. The Townsend Corporation, working with MCDONALD, has built the kits and will inform the Agency of sales to foreign powers. Courtney OWENS, Sales manager of Townsend Engineering Corporation, is a TSD/EB cleared source. The memo suggests that Mr. JONES interview MCDONALD to determine why U.S. Intelligence was mentioned in the article and to re-brief him if necessary. A copy of the memo is being sent to PSD (Attn: Robert SWENDIMAN) to determine if other Agency components have used MCDONALD.
