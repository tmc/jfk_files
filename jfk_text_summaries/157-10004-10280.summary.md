This document, released under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992, is a CIA cable dated October 10, 1957. It concerns allegations against Robert Maheu, specifically that he violated the Mann Act by procuring and transporting prostitutes for a foreign leader during a state visit to the U.S. in 1956, allegedly with the tacit approval of the State Department. The cable also alleges Maheu conducted wiretapping operations against the Onassis Shipping Co. in 1955, again with tacit U.S. government approval and knowledge of the CIA, State Department, and FBI.

Key people, organizations, and events mentioned:

*   **Robert Maheu:** Subject of the allegations, associated with Robert A. Maheu and Associates (RAMA).
*   **Foreign Leader:** Unnamed, but received prostitutes procured by Maheu.
*   **Onassis Shipping Co.:** Target of alleged wiretapping by Maheu.
*   **John Joseph Frank:** Suspected source of the documents containing the allegations against Maheu.
*   **COS:** CIA source who received the documents.
*   **DCM:** Addressee who received identical documents from EMCREEP.
*   **AMB Farland:** Addressee at the State Department.
*   **EMCREEP:** Individual who gave documents to DCM.
*   **CIA:** Central Intelligence Agency, the originator and recipient of the cable.
*   **State Department:** Allegedly aware of and tacitly approving Maheu's actions.
*   **FBI:** Allegedly aware of and tacitly approving Maheu's actions.

The cable suggests a possible motive for the allegations: blackmail of the U.S. government or disruption of the Frank Trial. The CIA expressed low interest in the information but agreed to pouch it. Another party, EMCREEP, gave identical documents to the DCM, who pouched them to the State Department for action by AMB Farland, indicating a desire for wide distribution within the U.S. government.
