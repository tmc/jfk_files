This document is a CIA information report, dated May 27, 1963, concerning the Frente Interno de Unidad Revolucionaria (FIUR) and the "Cuban Government in Arms." The report, numbered 00-K-3,262,509, originates from a Cuban national residing in the United States who was a prominent sports writer and member of the Havana Yacht Club, now working as a reporter with contacts among Cuban exile leaders.
