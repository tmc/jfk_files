This document is a memorandum from the Director of Finance to the Inspector General, dated 27 FEB 1974, regarding Howard Hunt. The Office of Finance searched its records to determine if any payment of approximately $30,000 was made to Mr. Hunt without requiring accounting.

**Key Findings and Points:**

*   **Search Scope:** The search included expense runs for various offices (Office of the DCI, Office of the DD/P, FI Staff, CI Staff, CA Staff, Office of Security), Madrid Station, JMWAVE, FR/Washington Office, and Mr. Hunt's travel claims.
*   **Madrid Assignment:** Mr. Hunt served under non-official cover in Madrid. No payments to him were found under his real name or pseudonyms.
*   **Advance Account:** $33,500 was advanced to Mr. Hunt for travel and transportation to and from Madrid, including a trip to Paris for visa renewals. This was fully accounted for, except for a $1,600 expenditure for a sensitive operation approved for write-off by Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald without further accounting.
*   **Bank Account:** A bank account was opened for Mr. Hunt at Chase Manhattan Bank to receive non-salary payments. $30,000 was deposited into the account during 1965 and 1966, and all of it was accounted for through travel and transportation accountings.
*   **Unusual Aspect:** All costs for Mr. Hunt's non-official cover assignment in Madrid were charged to the EUR Division's support allotment, which is not normal.
*   **Recommendations:** It is suggested that Mr. Karamessines be questioned about projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational expenditures would have been charged. Another course of action is to request the Director to approve asking a cleared contact at Chase Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all entries into Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.
*   **Cashier's Checks:** The Office of Finance is reviewing records of cashier's checks to determine if any were payable to Mr. Hunt.

**People:**

*   Howard Hunt
*   Desmond Fitzgerald
*   Mr. Karamessines
*   Thomas B. Yale (Director of Finance)

**Organizations:**

*   CIA (Central Intelligence Agency)
*   Office of Finance

*   FR/Washington Office

*   Riggs National Bank

**Locations:**

*   Madrid
*   Paris
*   Washington

**Conclusions:**

The Office of Finance has not found any unaccounted payments of approximately $30,000 to Howard Hunt. However, there are some unusual aspects of his non-official cover assignment in Madrid, including the charging of costs to the EUR Division's support allotment and the lack of operational expenditures (except for $1,600). Further investigation is recommended, including questioning Mr. Karamessines and obtaining a transcript of Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.
