Summary of Document:

This document is a memorandum summarizing a tape-recorded conversation between Mr. William D. Pawley and an unidentified Cuban, believed to be a member of a group of wealthy anti-Castro Cubans, during the period of October 17-18, 1959. The Cuban discussed plans for sabotage of the coming sugar harvest and mentioned contact with a representative of General Jose Eleuterio Pedraza, leader of Cuban revolutionary groups in the Dominican Republic.
