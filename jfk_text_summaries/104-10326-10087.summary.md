This document is a message from the Mexico City station of an unnamed organization (likely a US intelligence agency) to its headquarters regarding issues related to the John F. Kennedy assassination.

**People:**

*   **Oswald:** Refers to Lee Harvey Oswald, the assassin of JFK.
*   **Fuller:** Refers to a person whose disclosure of a role with the tapes is mentioned.

**Organizations:**

*   **Russian Embassy:** Target of TELTAP operations.
*   **Cuban Embassy:** Target of TELTAP operations.
*   **Mexican Liaison Services:** Partner in joint TELTAP operations.

**Events:**

*   **JFK Assassination:** The subject of the document.
*   **TELTAP Operations:** Joint operations with Mexican liaison against Russian and Cuban Embassies.

**Nations:**

*   **Mexico:** Location of the station and partner in liaison operations.
*   **Russia:** Country of the embassy targeted in TELTAP operations.
*   **Cuba:** Country of the embassy targeted in TELTAP operations.
*   **United States:** Country of origin for the document.

**Conclusions:**

*   The station is conducting joint TELTAP operations with Mexican liaison against the Russian and Cuban embassies.
*   The station is initiating a unilateral TELTAP operation against the Cuban embassy and residences.
*   Official acknowledgement of the source of TELTAP tapes on Oswald would negatively impact the liaison relationship with Mexico.
*   Exposure of past joint operations with Mexico could force the Mexicans to reassess their relationship and question the ability to maintain discretion.
*   Preservation of station liaison equities is paramount due to high interest in narcotrafficking, terrorism, and counterintelligence in Mexico.
*   The station encourages headquarters to keep previous joint operations with the Mexicans secret.
*   Disclosure of a NOC's involvement with Oswald tapes could draw liaison attention to possible station use of NOCs in Mexico and lead to closer screening of U.S. businessmen in Mexico.
