This document, dated March 18, 1961, is a memo from Trial Stratton (WH/4/Security) to Mr. Jack Kennedy (WH/4/Security) regarding Cours Wood and his activities. Stratton spent hours with Wood discussing his plans and participation in the "FRAY FOR CUBA COMITEE". Stratton believes Wood is naive about Stratton's position with the Agency and is frank with him. Stratton believes he can obtain information on Wood's associates.

Wood and his father possess Communist publications, including "U.S.S.R." and "The Worker," and pamphlets published in England. Wood is described as an extreme leftist and a believer in Castro's Cuba.

Wood and friends plan to illegally enter Cuba in June, aiming to become terrorists for the Castro government. Members of the "26th of July Movement" are involved. Stratton hopes to gather names and facts about their plans.
