**Summary:**

This memorandum details a conversation between Mexican President Adolfo López Mateos and Winston Scott, the CIA's Chief of Station in Mexico, on June 7, 1960. López Mateos conveyed a message for President Dwight D. Eisenhower, assuring him of Mexico's friendship with the United States. He clarified that the invitation to Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado was extended after it was indicated Dorticos was going to Mexico "on his own", and that he would refuse any request from Dorticos to invite Fidel Castro to Mexico.

Most notably, López Mateos expressed delight that a decision had been made to "get rid of Castro." This sentiment was reinforced through an indirect communication between Scott and José Lorenzo Cossio, an advisor to López Mateos. Scott suggested that Mexican assistance in the CIA's efforts to overthrow Castro would eliminate the potential problem of inviting Castro to Mexico.
