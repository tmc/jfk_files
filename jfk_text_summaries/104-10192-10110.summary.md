*   The Chilean PDC is the only party with the responsibility of governing.
*   COPEI in Venezuela has strong hopes of winning in 1968.
*   The PDC in El Salvador has become the leading opposition party.
*   The Peruvian PDC is part of a coalition government.
*   Several CD parties have moderate potential: Dominican Republic, Panama, Brazil, and Guatemala.
*   The remaining CD parties show scant promise of developing into forces of national importance.
*   CD strength in universities is ahead of party strength.
*   Radicalization of youth wings is a concern for CD leaders.
*   CLASC poses a serious danger for the CD movement.
*   ODCA contributes little positive direction.
*   European CD parties provide financial support to Latin American CD parties.
*   CDs challenge Communist domination of the university.
*   CD failure to transform affinity of lower classes into votes.
*   Individual party fortunes appear unaffected by CD progress elsewhere.
*   Growth potential exists, but much less than originally anticipated.
*   Need for an eclectic operational approach to CD's.
