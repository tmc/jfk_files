This document is a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) information report, dated August 10, 1963, concerning the possible establishment of a Cuban exile base in Nicaragua.

**Key People and Organizations:**

*   **Salvador Romani:** Representative in Venezuela of the Cuban exile organization Comando Unificado de la Liberacion en Cuba (CULC).
*   **Comando Unificado de la Liberacion en Cuba (CULC):** (United Command of Cuban Liberation) A Cuban exile organization.
*   **President Somoza:** President of Nicaragua.
*   **Manuel Artime:** Secretary General of the exile group Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR).
*   **Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR):** (Movement of Revolutionary Recovery) A Cuban exile group.
*   **JURE (Junta Revolucionaria):** A Cuban exile group led by Manuel Ray.
*   **MRP (Movimiento Revolucionario Popular):** (Popular Revolutionary Movement) A Cuban exile group.
*   **UMC (Unidades Militares Cubanas):** (Cuban Military Units) A Cuban exile group.
*   **CLC (Comandos Libres de Cuba):** (Free Cuba Commandos) A Cuban exile group.
*   **FUR (Frente Unido Revolucionario):** (United Revolutionary Front) A Cuban exile group led by Aureliano Sanchez Arango.
*   **Fidel Castro:** Leader of Cuba.

**Key Events and Locations:**

*   **Nicaragua:** Possible location for a Cuban exile base.
*   **Cuba:** Target of exile activities.
*   **Miami:** Location from which Cuban exiles may have moved to Nicaragua.
*   **Venezuela:** Location where Salvador Romani is based.
*   **England, London:** Location where the information was acquired.

**Conclusions and Claims:**

*   A small number of Cuban exiles had already moved from Miami to Nicaragua, possibly reflecting an agreement between President Somoza of Nicaragua and Manuel Artime of MRR.
*   If a large-scale exile military base is established in Nicaragua, other exile groups will await the reaction of the United States before deciding their own course of action.
*   The nucleus of such a base would be drawn from 3,000-4,000 exiles who have received military training from members of the U.S. Armed Forces.
*   U.S. policy is to ferment internal resistance in Cuba and strengthen the resistance by infiltration of trained commando groups of exiles, providing tacit support for the training of exile military organizations.
*   The report reviews the policies of principal exile parties, including CULC, JURE, MRP, Second Front of Escambray, Alpha 66, UMC, CLC, MRR, and FUR, regarding their approaches to overthrowing the Cuban regime.
