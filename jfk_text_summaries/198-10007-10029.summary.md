*   **OSI/ORR (Office of Scientific Intelligence/Office of Research and Reports):** Source of data on available receivers.
*   **ONE (Office of National Estimates):** Source of data on Soviet jamming transmitters.
*   **USIS (United States Information Service):** To collaborate with indigenous radio systems in friendly and neutral nations.

**Conclusions and Recommendations:**

*   The USSR and its satellites have a numerical advantage in radio broadcasting hours.
*   The free world is not doing enough to counter Communist radio propaganda, especially in Western Europe.
*   CIA should exploit indigenous radio systems in friendly and neutral nations.
*   CIA should develop capabilities to electronically intrude upon Communist radio broadcasts.
*   CIA should strengthen and streamline the machinery for policy guidance.
*   CIA should establish machinery for evaluating the substance, coverage, impact, and management of radio operations.
*   CIA should undertake a recruitment and training program for personnel qualified for covert radio broadcasting.
*   CIA should proceed with the development of capabilities to electronically intrude upon and otherwise exploit the Communist radio broadcasting to their own and foreign audiences.
*   CIA should create a small staff element to supervise CIA planning and operations in covert radio broadcasting.
*   The report recommends a country-by-country analysis of indigenous broadcasting and television systems for penetration.
*   The report recommends exploring a joint undertaking with the State Department to exploit intelligence sources for propaganda.
*   The report recommends developing an improved method for issuing policy guidance to the field.
*   The report recommends preparing a project to produce broadcasting devices capable of electronic intrusion into Communist broadcasts.
*   The report emphasizes the need for absolute CIA control of broadcast content and management, strict security, and sufficient cover to deny official connection.
*   The report recommends focusing on unconventional radio broadcasting techniques to counter Soviet jamming.
