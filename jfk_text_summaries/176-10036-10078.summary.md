This document is a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) telegram, dated September 13, 1962, reporting on opposition in Khanh Hoa Province, South Vietnam. The report, based on information from a medium-level official in the General Confederation of Vietnamese Labor (CVTC), details opposition to the arming of mountain tribesmen and the Strategic Hamlet Program. Provincial authorities feared the tribesmen would indiscriminately kill innocent Vietnamese, and the population opposed the Strategic Hamlet Program due to excessive demands for labor, materials, and money. The report also highlights conflict among provincial authorities, with Major Le Tap, the Province Chief, unable to manage the situation. Ba (FNU), the Deputy Province Chief for Security and associate of Brigadier General Ton That Dinh, and Truong Dinh Cac, the Deputy Province Chief for Economic Matters assigned by Ngo Dinh Can (brother of President Ngo Dinh Diem), wield significant influence. Cac's assignment was specifically to bring provincial economic activities under the control of Can and his faction in the Can Lao Party. Yang (FNU), the Deputy Province Chief for Administration, is described as lacking authority.
