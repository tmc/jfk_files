This document is a memorandum summarizing the minutes of a Special Group meeting held on June 6, 1961. The meeting was attended by Messrs. Bowles, Gilpatric, Bundy, Ralph Dungan, and Dulles.

**Key Topics and Decisions:**

*   **Congo:** The group discussed a plan for the Congo, with Bowles conditioning his approval on the acceptance of three provisions from a State Department memorandum. Dulles raised concerns about including Gizenga or his representative in the Leopoldville Government, fearing Moscow's influence. Bundy deferred approval to higher authority.
*   **Political Action Projects:** Bundy stated that higher authority wanted to review programs involving covert support to political parties and leaders in friendly countries. Dulles emphasized the need for State Department support and some latitude for the Special Group to make decisions within a general policy framework.
*   **Francis Gary Powers:** Discussion of release procedures was deferred.
*   **Vietnam:** A STPOLLY flight with Chinat personnel was approved. A covert annex for Vietnam was also approved.
*   **Korea:** Bundy wanted to check a covert annex further due to higher authority's interest in political action operations.
*   **TACKLE:** Dulles wanted to discuss TACKLE, but a final decision was deferred. Gilpatric supported the need for information from TACKLE and suggested using U.S. personnel. Dulles cautioned against using American personnel due to potential risks.
*   **Nicaragua:** Dulles outlined the need to negotiate with Somoza to recover equipment remaining at Puerto Cabezas. Bundy stated this should be handled between the Agency and the Department of State.
*   **Cuba:** Dulles raised the issue of the Agency's relations with exile groups, payments to dependents, and supported publications. It was agreed that the Agency would discuss this with Deputy Assistant Secretary Morales-Carrion and submit a formal proposal.
*   **Minutes of Special Group Meetings:** The group discussed procedures for distributing and approving the minutes of Special Group meetings.
