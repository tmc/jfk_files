This document is a memorandum from S.J. Papich of the FBI to Mr. L'Allier, dated June 26, 1961, regarding Jorge Beliard, a station manager for Cubana Airlines at Idlewild International Airport in New York City. The CIA had submitted a name check request concerning Beliard, and the FBI liaison sought to determine the purpose of this request.

Jane Roman of the CIA informed the FBI that a Cuban source suggested Beliard could be of use to the Agency in connection with its operations in Cuba, specifically in arranging courier routes between Cuba and the United States. The CIA believed Beliard's contacts in Cubana Airlines and his possible association with individuals who travel regularly between the two countries could facilitate communication with clandestine sources inside Cuba. The FBI requested the CIA not to contact Beliard pending further word from the Bureau.

The memo outlines three possible courses of action for the FBI: (1) prohibit the CIA from contacting Beliard due to current Bureau operational interest, (2) permit the CIA to maintain contact with Beliard to explore its interests, or (3) the FBI could talk to Beliard concerning the potential for establishing courier routes and serve as the intermediary.
