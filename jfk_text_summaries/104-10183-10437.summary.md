This memorandum details a meeting on May 25, 1965, between AMBUNNY-1 (201-775391), AMWHIP-1 (201-267966), and Norris W. Damicone (alias Al Marin) regarding a planned operation. The meeting took place in New York at AMWHIP-1's office.

**Key Points:**

*   **AMBUNNY-1's Background:** AMWHIP-1 expressed concern that AMBUNNY-1's previous employment with the U.S. Ambassador in Bolivia could jeopardize the operation, specifically her penetration of the UNSNAFU-19 office. He feared exposure of his connection with ODYOKE and loss of his connections with UNSNAFU-19 and "Habana" if the Cubans discovered her background.
*   **Cutout Suggestion:** AMWHIP-1 proposed using a cutout to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the UNSNAFU-19 installation.
*   **Paris Operation Cancelled:** A planned operation in Paris was cancelled due to AMWHIP-1's unavailability and subsequent consultation with DI UBALDO. AMBUNNY-1 was informed of a potential operation in Rabat.
