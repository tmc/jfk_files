Here's a summary of the document, focusing on key elements:

**Subject:** Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV (201-779495)

**Time Period:** August 1964 - March 1977

**Summary:**

The documents concern Ivan Dmitriyevich OBYEDKOV, a Soviet citizen who worked as a guard at the Soviet Embassies in Mexico City and Tehran. He is suspected of being affiliated with Soviet Intelligence (RIS), possibly the KGB, due to his perceived higher education level than his guard duties would suggest, his financial status, and associations with known or suspected RIS officers.

**Key Events & Observations:**

*   **Mexico City (1962-1965):** OBYEDKOV worked as a guard, tending the telephone, guarding the gate, delivering messages, and occasionally driving embassy cars. He spoke poor Spanish. His wife, Yelena Lvovna, served as the director of the Soviet Primary School and ran a summer camp. He associated with several Soviets, some of whom were known or suspected GRU or KGB officers.
*   **Tehran (1967-1971):** OBYEDKOV again served as a guard at the Soviet Embassy. His wife continued to work as a school principal. He was noted for being very security conscious.
*   **London (1977):** OBYEDKOV is working as an electrician at the Soviet Embassy.

**Conclusions:**

While OBYEDKOV's activities and associations raised suspicions of intelligence affiliation, no concrete evidence was found to confirm he was actively involved in intelligence operations. The documents suggest a debate within the intelligence community about whether to continue considering him a suspect RIS officer. By 1977, the assessment was that there was no evidence to support an intelligence affiliation, and the decision was made to no longer carry him as suspect RIS, probably KGB.
