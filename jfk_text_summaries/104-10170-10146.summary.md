This document is a memorandum dated 9 July 1967, concerning Emilio Santana Galindo (201-335856) and the Garrison Investigation, likely related to the John F. Kennedy assassination. It details Galindo's recruitment by the Agency in October 1962, his limited training, and participation in an infiltration operation in May 1963, after which he exfiltrated and was terminated. The memo lists staff and agent personnel who had contact with Galindo, including Eugene E. Norwinsk, Robert G. L. Wall, William R. Stegall, Vernon J. Goertz, Robert Clark Stevens Jr, Robert Charles Bachmann, Donald D. Never, Dewey A. Stinson, Jose Enrique DAUSA Alvarez, Jose NUNEZ Paez, Alicio NUNEZ Paez, Raul QUESADA Freire, Otto GINER Alonso, Alberto RUIZ Falcon, Joaquin POWELL Rubio, Jose Luis FORNELL Jacinto, Luis Albert BELTRAN Nodarso, Juan Luis COSCULLUELA Iduate, Manuel VIERA Rodriguez, Juan Carlos JIMENEZ Jimenez, Diego Mario GIMENEZ Cadenas, and Heriberto SARDINA Del Campo. The Agency has no record of Galindo's activities between October and December 1963. The document was prepared by AC/R/COG. The memo was created in response to concerns about the impact of Garrison's investigation and/or NBC's reporting on the Agency due to Galindo's involvement.
