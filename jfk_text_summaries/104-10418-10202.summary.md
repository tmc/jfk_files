Summary of the document regarding Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO:

Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO, a Soviet KGB officer, defected in 1964 and was subsequently involuntarily confined in the U.S. by the CIA for approximately three years. He first contacted Agency personnel in Switzerland in June 1962. From April 1964 to August 1965, he was confined at an Agency controlled site in Clinton, Maryland, and from August 1965 to October 1967, at Camp Peary, Virginia. He was given total freedom in April 1969 and became a U.S. citizen in April 1974. He was employed by the Agency as a consultant in March 1969 and continues under contract.

Key individuals and entities involved include:

*   **Yurily Ivanovich NOSENKO:** Soviet KGB officer and defector.
*   **Richard Helms:** DD/P (Deputy Director/Plans) of the CIA.
*   **Lawrence Houston:** Agency General Counsel.
*   **FBI:** Conducted a report concluding NOSENKO was a bona fide defector.
*   **CIA (Agency):** The organization that confined and later employed NOSENKO.
*   **Department of Justice:** Was made aware of the NOSENKO affair.
*   **White House:** Was made aware of the NOSENKO affair.
*   **Charles Phalen:** Contact at OS/SSD.

The legal basis for NOSENKO's confinement was discussed with the Deputy Attorney General on April 2, 1964, and the Agency General Counsel advised that such confinement was proper. Various agencies, including the Department of Justice and the White House, were aware of the NOSENKO affair.

Reports from the Office of Security and the FBI concluded that NOSENKO was a bona fide defector, although the CI Staff raised questions regarding this conclusion. The rationale for NOSENKO's prolonged confinement was concern for his safety and doubts about his bona fides. During a pleasure trip to Florida in 1969, Agency personnel obtained the services of prostitutes for him. NOSENKO continues under contract to the Agency.
