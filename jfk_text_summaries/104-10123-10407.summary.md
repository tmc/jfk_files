**Summary:**

This document is a recommendation for an Honor and Merit Award for James W. McCord, Jr., along with William M. Marcy and Alan F. Petit, from the Director of Security within the CIA. The recommendation stems from their work in developing a new technique in fluoroscopic scanning for detecting clandestine microphones and other devices. This technique is considered a major breakthrough and provides the Agency with a new capability to detect hidden listening devices. The technique involves using X-rays in combination with a fluoroscopic screen and a newly designed fluoroscopic cloth. They also developed an easily transportable package for the equipment. The innovation is expected to significantly enhance the security of Agency installations both domestically and internationally.
