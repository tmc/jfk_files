This document discusses meetings and operations related to a target, possibly an individual, referred to as "Target" who has cooperated in previous attempts to contact him. The President is not aware of these meetings. There is a high risk of discovery which could damage relations. It was deemed prudent to inform the President unilaterally, requesting they simply accept future reports as is.

A source, referred to as "Salv," provided information on party activities and relations with other parties. Salv arranged Moscow travel for Renan Rodas Lazo, Pedro Raul Farsan Medrano, Roberto Armijo Navarrete, and one other individual. Salv believes the PCES Central Committee includes Shafick Handal, Jorge Arias Gomez, and Raul Castellanos Figueroa. Party pseudos for Salv, Handal, and Castellanos are Ampedro, Ald, and Fernandez, respectively. Salv and Jose Manlio Argueta were trained by PAD GW.

The PCES has an estimated 622 members, is well-organized in San Salvador, but weak in the countryside. FUAR is practically inactive. The document also mentions Roque Dalton, who is not a member of PCES. The government is concerned about his disappearance. Dalton is a PCES member since 1955, his suspension was considered because he took asylum in Mexico in 1963.

Meetings are scheduled with MEX on 23 September and at Anexo on 29 September, and with Morallang on 28 September. A meeting also took place in Sisli.
