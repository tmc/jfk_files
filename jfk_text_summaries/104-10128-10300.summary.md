This document summarizes a discussion on February 1, 1961, regarding the operational use of Michael Weimer Stratton (#188074) within the United States by the CIA's WH/4/Propaganda division. Kammer coordinated with Mr. McCORD of SRS concerning the potential counterintelligence (CI) implications of the operation, particularly the risk of Stratton attracting the attention of the FBI through his association with Court WOOK. David Atlee PHILLIPS (#40695) is supervising the operation. McCORD decided against immediately informing the FBI but requested a review of Stratton's and Phillips' files on March 1, 1961.
