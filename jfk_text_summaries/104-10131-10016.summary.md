This document details a request for alias documentation for Harold F. Swenson, also known as Harold Francis Safley, by the CIA. The request, initiated by Howard J. Preston, Chief of TFW/Support, is directed to the Technical Services Division, Authentication Branch, and specifically to Mr. Kuhnke. George A. Ladner, Jr. is available for inquiries.

The documentation is needed for Swenson to make contacts in the near future, potentially in New York and Latin America. The request includes a backstopped New York State Driver's License, a birth certificate, and pocket litter to support a legend of an industrial home. Swenson's physical characteristics, family information, and existing driver's licenses are provided to aid in creating the alias documentation. Victor R. White, Deputy Director of Security (Investigations and Operational Support), is also involved in the process.
