This document is a President's Intelligence Checklist, dated November 23, 1963, issued by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). It covers several international hotspots and Soviet activities.

**Key Points:**

*   **South Vietnam:** Communist efforts to destabilize the new Saigon regime are ongoing with increased armed attacks. The new government is responding with military operations and efforts to gain popular support. General Ton That Dinh is identified as an ambitious and potentially troublesome figure.
*   **Venezuela:** Communist extremists, supported by Castro, are attempting to disrupt national elections. The Betancourt government is responding with arrests. Concerns exist about the next president's ability to handle the situation and the potential for military intervention.
*   **USSR-Cuba:** Cuban military personnel are being trained on surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites by Soviet experts. A significant number of Soviet military personnel have been withdrawn from Cuba since the October crisis, leaving advisors to train Cubans. All Soviet weapons except the SAM system have been withdrawn or turned over to the Cubans.
*   **Berlin:** The Soviets may be planning to harass Allied access routes to West Berlin via the air corridors.
*   **Iraq-Syria-UAR:** President Arif's role in the recent coup in Baghdad may have been minimal, with Tahir Yahya being the organizer. The coup aimed to curtail the extreme wing of the Baath Party. Syrian Baathists support the new government, while Nasir's Egypt is backing away due to the inclusion of Baath members in the cabinet.
*   **USSR:** Soviet range instrumentation ships are heading to the Pacific, possibly for extended-range ICBM tests or a space event.
*   **Congo-USSR:** Soviet embassy personnel are being expelled from Leopoldville for complicity in anti-government plots.
*   **Britain:** The Labor Party is gaining support and pushing for general elections. Prime Minister Home is unlikely to agree.
*   **Ecuador:** A military junta is in power, and Colonel Freiles may attempt to seize full control.
*   **Thailand:** Prime Minister Sarit is terminally ill, and a power struggle is anticipated.
*   **USSR:** Cosmos 22, a recoverable satellite, was launched and recovered. Recoverable satellites are launched from Tyuratam, while non-recoverable ones are launched from Kapustin Yar.
