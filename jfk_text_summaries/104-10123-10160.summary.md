This memorandum, dated 19 January 1961, concerns a request for security approval to use Apartment 423 at the Warwick Apartments in Washington, D.C. as a covert site. SB/1 requested the approval to house a contract Agent. Mr. Marx Holder requires the site for EE PC/173 (Agent 172341), an Agent of the Security Research Staff. SAC/FO has granted permission and SF/2 is requested to grant security approval. Robert J. Leonard recommends that SB/1 be advised that there is no security objection to the contemplated use of this site, as the lease is in alias and the site is scheduled to be terminated on 1 March 1961.
