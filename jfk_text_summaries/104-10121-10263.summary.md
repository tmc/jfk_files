This document, dated October 24, 1960, is a memorandum from Joseph F. Langan, Chief of WH/4/So, to the Office of Security, Attention Support Branch, regarding David S. Koples. It confirms a request from J.J. Mullane, Jr. to John Lavery to provide two backstopped residence addresses for Koples, one in Washington, D.C., and one in Los Angeles.

In Washington, D.C., Koples was to be identified as a recently returned State Department employee who had secured a new position with the Department of the Army, specifically the U.S. Army Staff-Group (telephone number OX 6-2255). His family was said to be in New England. This cover story was needed due to Koples' private business ventures in the Phoenix, Arizona area.

In Los Angeles, Koples was to be identified as a local representative for Bartlett and Rogers, a New York City concern, who conducted economic research related to Latin American trade. He supposedly moved to the Miami area on October 14, 1960. He was described as a single individual, approximately 35 years old, 6 feet tall, 200 lbs., with a swarthy complexion, dark hair, and eyes, earning over $10,000 per year.
