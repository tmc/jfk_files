This document is a memorandum dated December 14, 1950, from the Chief of the Overseas Branch to the Chief of the Special Security Branch. It concerns John F. Rittenhouse (Pseudo - OPC), #23500. The memo instructs the cancellation of Rittenhouse's security clearance dated December 7, 1950, because he is now considered a semi-covert employee integrated into the Department of the Army, rather than deep cover. Joseph S. Reff is the author of the memorandum. The case was closed and moved on December 19, 1950.
