This 1967 memorandum from N.J. Katten, Chief of WH/I, details the activities of WI/I concerning organizations listed in a memo on the "Council for Latin America." It outlines involvement with four organizations:

1.  **Confederación Mexicana de Cámaras Industriales:** Receives partial support of $60,000 annually from WI/I and $950,000 yearly from **MISEREOR**, a German Catholic fund based in Aachen, Germany. The goal is to improve the social and economic status of Mexican campesinos.

2.  **Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales y Económicas:** The executive director was formerly associated with the **LIEF** project. The project is funded at $4,300 annually and supports **LIEF-1**, the Station's agent with access to rightist political organizations.

3.  **Centro Nacional de Estudios Sociales:** The director (**LISIFER-3**) is no longer an active **LOFT** agent. The **LESIFER** project, terminated in 1965, was funded at $165,000 annually and supported a mass media propaganda effort in Mexico, sponsored by a front group of conservative Mexican businessmen.

4.  **American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico:** The vice president (**LIIFT-1**) is a current Station asset, receiving $300.00 monthly. His duties primarily involve gathering information on rightist political organizations.
