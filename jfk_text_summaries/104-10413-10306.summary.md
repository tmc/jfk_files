Summary of the document:

This document contains preliminary research and theories regarding Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Soviet scientist, and his possible connection to the "unidentified man" photographed entering and leaving the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in October 1963. The research was initiated due to an in-depth study on potential Cuban involvement in the John F. Kennedy assassination.

Conclusions:

*   The research is theoretical and unofficial.
*   There are striking parallels between MOSKALEV and "Saul" from the book "Appointment in Dallas."
*   Identification experts believe MOSKALEV could likely be the "unidentified man."
*   The possibility of a Soviet conspiracy in the Kennedy assassination, potentially without Cuban knowledge, is being considered.
