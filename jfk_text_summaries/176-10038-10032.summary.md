This document is a telegram from the U.S. Embassy in Saigon to the Secretary of State, dated November 16, 1961, regarding the Task Force on Vietnam. It discusses opportunities to exploit the new management of the National Police and Security Service in South Vietnam, specifically Colonel Nguyen Van Y replacing General Nguyen Van (La).

Key points:

*   **Organizations:** CAS (likely referring to the Central Intelligence Agency), USOM (United States Operations Mission), National Police and Security Service, Surete (National Security Police), Communist Party, CINCPAC (Commander in Chief, Pacific), POLAD (Political Advisor)
*   **People:** Colonel Nguyen Van Y, General Nguyen Van (La), Nolting (likely the U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam, Frederick Nolting)
*   **Nations:** United States, Vietnam
*   **Events:** Task Force on Vietnam
*   **Proposed Actions:**
    *   CAS proposes developing a "Special Branch" of the Surete to penetrate the Communist Party, with CAS officers at regional directorates (Hue, Nha Trang, Ban Me Thuot, Bien Hoa, Saigon/Cholon, and Can Tho).
    *   CAS would provide intelligence and training to Vietnamese officers and financial assistance for agent networks.
    *   USOM aims to develop the national police structure, consolidate civil police functions under the Secretary of State for Interior, delineate functions of public safety services, implement a training program, and develop an effective public safety service.
*   **Conclusion:** The embassy urges full support from the Task Force and Washington for these suggestions, including necessary personnel and budget additions.
