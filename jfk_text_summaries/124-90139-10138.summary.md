This document, dated May 10, 1965, originates from the FBI and concerns "CIA Liaison Material" and "Foreign Political Matters - Cuba." It is classified as Secret.

The document details information from a "highly confidential informant" regarding comments made by Cuban Foreign Minister Raul Roa around February 20, 1963. Roa expressed pessimism about Cuba's situation, stating it had deteriorated due to the failure of talks at the United Nations. He believed the situation was similar to that before the Cuban Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962, citing "pirate boat activities," a campaign in the United States, and a statement by President Kennedy.

Roa felt the United States benefited from the crisis by excluding the UN Security Council and allowing the Organization of American States (OAS) to handle the situation. He anticipated the OAS would consider proposals for a collective breakoff of relations with Cuba, including postal contacts. He predicted Mexico would accept such resolutions with reservations, Bolivia, Chile, and Uruguay would accept everything, and Brazil would likely oppose them. Roa believed talks between President Kennedy and President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela would influence the OAS action.

Roa also commented that it would have been better if the Cuban situation had been handled by the United Nations Security Council. He agreed that time was working in Cuba's favor, permitting internal consolidation, and economic and organizational endeavors. He also mentioned the differences within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the hope for settlement of differences in the Soviet Bloc and prospects for general relaxing of strained relations between all countries.

Roa's comments suggested he disagreed with the Soviet Union's decision to place missiles in Cuba in 1962.

The document is classified "Top Secret" because unauthorized disclosure would reveal a high-level intelligence operation involving CPRIME, an extremely sensitive source at the Polish UN Delegations.
