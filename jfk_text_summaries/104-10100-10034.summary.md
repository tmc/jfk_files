This document is a cable from the Director of the CIA to multiple stations and bases regarding the PERUMEN (ZR)PRIMA program, a Cuban technician recruiting program.

**Key Points:**

*   **Program Assessment:** A review concluded that the ZRPRIMA program has not achieved significant results and its continuation is no longer warranted.
*   **Reasons for Failure:** The main reason for the failure is the Cuban technician recruiting program. The original objective of recruiting 2000 technicians from Western Europe was not met. Less than fifty candidates received contract approval, and only about ten actually made it to Cuba.
*   **Cuban Ineptitude:** The Cuban failure to recruit is attributed to the reluctance of the Foreign Ministry and Foreign Service officers, bureaucratic incompetence in Havana, fear of infiltration by hostile agents, and a possible loss of interest from Fidel Castro.
*   **CIA Efforts:** The CIA (KUBARK) succeeded in inserting about thirty recruited technicians into hiring channels, but only two received contract approval from Havana.
*   **Recommendations:** Stations with active leads should continue to pursue them, but cease generating new leads. Stations should remain alert for opportunities to place resident agents in Cuba.
*   **Cuban Recruitment Practices:** Cuban officials responsible for recruiting technicians tend to rely on local Communist Party (CP) approval or other strong indications of political acceptability.
*   **CIA Performance:** The CIA's response in implementing ZRPRIMA was considered gratifying, providing the Cubans with qualified engineers and technicians. The failure to achieve significant results is attributed to Cuban confusion and ineptitude.
*   **Discontinuation:** The use of the USA ZRPRIMA slug should be discontinued, and the file should be filed under 200-120-47.
