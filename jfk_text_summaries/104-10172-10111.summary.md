The files include FBI reports from New York, Boston, and Washington D.C. dating from 1955 to 1961, focusing on Halperin and individuals associated with him, such as Jane Constance Kroll Rogers and Benjamin Fastov, and David C. Halperin. There are also State Department documents, specifically dispatches and telegrams from the American Embassy in Moscow regarding Halperin's citizenship and passports.

A document transfer form indicates that Halperin is a male, possibly a citizen of the USSR, and that Albert Maltz sent him a letter in November 1961 discussing Halperin's work in the USSR and concerns about the McCarran Act.

A dispatch from the Chief of Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the WH Division includes a booklet written by Maurice Halperin titled "Desarrollo Economico y Crisis en la America Latina" (Economic Development and Crisis in Latin America), published by the Universidad Obrera de Mexico (UOM), which is controlled by the Partido Popular Socialista (PPS). The introduction to the booklet is written by Vicente Lombardo Toledano, secretary-general of the PPS.

The introduction to Halperin's booklet provides biographical information, stating he was born in Boston in 1906, educated at Harvard and the University of Oklahoma, and received a doctorate from the University of Paris. He held positions at the University of Oklahoma, the War Department, the State Department, and the United Nations. He also taught at the University of Boston, the University of San Pablo in Brazil, and the Universidad Nacional de Mexico. At the time of the booklet's publication, Halperin was a Visiting Professor at the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.

Halperin's booklet discusses the economic crisis in Latin America, attributing it to the region's dependence on exporting raw materials and importing manufactured goods. He argues that the crisis presents an opportunity to eliminate neocolonial dependence, citing Cuba as an example. He analyzes Latin America's economic expansion from 1945 to 1957, attributing it to external factors such as increased demand for exports and favorable trade conditions. He notes that while the region experienced growth, it was not sufficient to meet its development needs. He also examines the economic performance of individual countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Cuba.
