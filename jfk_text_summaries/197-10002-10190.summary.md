This document is a CIA telegram, dated November 29, 1963, summarizing the German Service Military Weekly Summary No. 48/63, covering November 20-26, 1963. The report details observations of Soviet Bloc military activity following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963.

**Key Points:**

*   **Soviet Military Alert:** Following Kennedy's assassination, Soviet and satellite forces took precautionary measures, interpreted as a reaction to potential U.S. military stand-by measures.
*   **Oranienburg Garrison Alert:** On the night of November 22/23, special alert measures were ordered in the Oranienburg Garrison for NVA (National People's Army of East Germany) units and possibly Soviet Army units, presumably in connection with Kennedy's assassination. This alert was apparently confined to the Berlin area.
*   **East German Border Control:** Since mid-October 1963, control posts were staggered in depths of up to 1 kilometer from the interzonal border during weekend nights.
*   **Soviet Ground Forces:** Recruit training was observed at local training grounds and driving schools. Elements of the 34th Artillery Division showed tentative signs of activity outside garrisons since November 24.
