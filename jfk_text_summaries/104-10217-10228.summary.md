**Summary:**

This is a contact report from January 25, 1963, detailing a meeting at Safe House #2. The meeting involved Kulpa, Tipteft, and Lavton. The purpose was to inform Kulpa that Headquarters approved his trip to the Congo and to give instructions to Meinturff. Lavton was awaiting instructions from Holden, who planned to be in town on Saturday. Serge Michel agreed that K.K. would shoot the first six covers on the new trique Revolutionaire (I). Kulpa was contacted by Gibson, who informed him that Dave Watts, who runs a "highly suspect sheet" in New York City, had asked Gibson for photos. Gibson will purchase and forward several of K.'s negatives. The rest of the meeting was spent on Tipteft straightening out his accountings. The next meeting was scheduled for January 29.
