This document is a report from the Honor Awards Board dated March 2, 1959. It concerns a recommendation for an award, specifically a Certificate of Merit with Distinction, for an individual whose name is partially redacted (Last, First, Middle). The individual held the position of Acting D.p. Chtos/c/00 and was assigned to the Security office. The award was recommended for heroic action or meritorious achievement/service between July 1 and August 15, 1953.

The Honor Awards Board disapproved the recommendation, concluding that the service performed, while valuable, was not outstanding enough to warrant an honor award.
