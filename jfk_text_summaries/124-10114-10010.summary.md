**Summary:**

The document details a "crank letter" received by the American Ambassador to Spain, written in Spanish by someone using the alias "Antilin PERIS." The letter claims the author fled Paris after an "indiscretion" and while there, obtained a document related to the Kennedy assassination that was allegedly stolen from the Warren Commission. The letter further alleges that the document is prejudicial to President Johnson and that there is an attempt to sell it to "Paris-Match," with involvement from someone at the British Embassy in Paris. The FBI is investigating the matter, with assistance from the CIA and the High General Staff (HGS) in Madrid, Spain, to identify and locate the letter's author.
