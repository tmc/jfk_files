This document is a CIA intelligence report (TDCS-3/544,531) from April 20, 1963, detailing statements made by **Ngo Dinh Nhu** regarding the withdrawal of American aid to **South Vietnam**. The report, based on information gathered in late March and early April 1963 in **Saigon**, Vietnam, suggests that Nhu advocated for reducing reliance on American aid, aiming for eventual self-sufficiency.

**Key Points:**

*   **Ngo Dinh Nhu's Stance:** Nhu proposed a policy to revise South Vietnam's approach to receiving American aid, with the ultimate goal of terminating it. He categorized aid into priorities: essential means of production, aid that could be phased out, and aid that could be terminated immediately.
*   **Self-Sufficiency Initiatives:** Nhu ordered the Ministry of Interior to encourage local production of weapons and ammunition to achieve self-sufficiency.
*   **American Influence:** Nhu expressed concerns about the number of American advisors in South Vietnam and the use of aid as a means of pressuring the **Government of Vietnam (GVN)**, citing the Royal Thai Air Force gasoline delivery incident as an example.
*   **Vietnamese Air Force (VNAF) Concerns:** **Colonel Huynh Huu Hien**, VNAF Commander, relayed Nhu's instructions to prepare for a complete withdrawal of American aid. VNAF officers, including **Major Dang Dinh Linh**, **Major Tran Do Cung**, and **Captain Ha Duong Doan**, expressed concerns that the VNAF would be unable to continue operations without American support and that any withdrawal would lead to the regime's collapse.
*   **Appraisal:** The CIA assesses that Nhu likely made the statements regarding reducing aid and initiating self-sufficiency measures. However, it is doubtful that he instructed GVN officials to prepare for a complete withdrawal of American aid. The VNAF officers' reaction to Hien's version of Nhu's statements is considered likely true.
*   **Mentioned Nations:** United States, South Vietnam, Thailand
