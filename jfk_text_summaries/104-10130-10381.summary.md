This document is a memorandum regarding Mr. Boris D. TARASOFF's security clearance for a PCS (Permanent Change of Station) to Mexico City. The Office of Security will grant the clearance with the proviso that WHD (likely a division within the CIA) is aware that TARASOFF and his family are known to be CIA and are also known by USSR representatives due to his past work as an interpreter/translator in the U.S. While performing these duties, TARASOFF was given cover as either a Department of State employee or a U.S. Government Contract Employee. W.S. RENEHAN of WH/Pers confirms that WHD is aware of and accepts this proviso.
