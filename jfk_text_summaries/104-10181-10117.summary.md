This memorandum, dated March 8, 1967, concerns possible animosity held by the DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate), specifically its leader Luis FERNANDEZ Rocha, towards President John F. Kennedy. The author, Calvin Thomas, recalls working on funding the DRE's overseas elements from Spring 1961 until late Summer 1963 while assigned to JMWAVE. Ross CROZIER was the case officer for the DRE during this period.

The DRE is believed to be the same group referred to as the Cuban Student Directorate in investigations into Kennedy's assassination, with its New Orleans representative allegedly having had contacts with Lee Harvey OSWALD. Thomas expresses concern that the DRE's disappointment with President Kennedy's handling of Cuba, potentially manifesting as anger or contempt, might have led to a desire for revenge. He suggests that officers who worked with the DRE after the summer of 1963 might have more information on this possibility.
