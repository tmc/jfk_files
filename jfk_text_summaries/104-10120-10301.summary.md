This document is an office memorandum regarding Balines N. Hidalgo Jr. The memo concerns a request for security approval for Hidalgo, who is being sent to San Salvador for 30 days. While his file is non-derogatory, he was a former FBI informant, and the State Department was reluctant to consider him in 1957. The memo asks whether the recipient wishes to check with the State Department before approving the certification.
