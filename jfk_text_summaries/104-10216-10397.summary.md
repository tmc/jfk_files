This document is a message from Rome to the Director, concerning the individual AMLASH.

**People:**

*   **Joseph Langosch:** Being assigned to PRAN as PBRUMEN Regional Service, will visit Rome to brief PRESLAND.
*   **AMWHIP/2:** Involved marginally, appears to be on the fringes of the main group.
*   **Desmond Fitzgerald:** Authenticating Officer
*   **Thomas F. Thiele:** C/WE/INT/ Release Officer
*   **GyyRyan:** C/WH/C/FI

**Organizations:**

*   **CIA (Central Intelligence Agency):** The document originates from within the CIA, specifically the Rome station, and is addressed to the Director.
*   **PBRUMEN:** A regional service to which Joseph Langosch is being assigned.

**Events:**

*   **Briefing by Joseph Langosch:** Langosch will brief PRESLAND in Rome, probably in August.
*   **Operation involving AMWHIP/2:** Rome may have specific operational plans involving AMWHIP/2.

**Conclusions:**

*   There is no definite evidence that the AMLASH complex is part of a doubled operation, but it is considered an insecure one.
*   AMWHIP/2's involvement is relatively marginal.
*   It is suggested that contact with AMWHIP/2 be minimized until Langosch can provide background information, unless Rome has specific operational plans involving him that need to be implemented soon.
