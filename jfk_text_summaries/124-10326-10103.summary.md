This is a SECRET memorandum from D.J. Brennan, Jr. to W.C. Sullivan, dated March 17, 1965, regarding "Bureau Informant 200." The memo discusses a procedure approved in 1954 where information from James Angleton of the CIA was attributed to "Bureau Informant 100." This information largely came from a Liaison arrangement between the CIA and the Israeli Intelligence Service, as well as other sources under Angleton's control. Allen Dulles authorized Angleton to disseminate this information to the Bureau, even if it wasn't disseminated within the CIA. The memo notes that valuable information continues to be received regularly.

The memo recommends reiterating instructions to the field offices (SAC) regarding Bureau Informant 100, as some offices rarely receive this information. This is particularly important because the Informant has recently been developing information about the travel of U.S. citizens to Russia via Israel.
