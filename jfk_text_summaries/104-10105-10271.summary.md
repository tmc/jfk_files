This document is a routing and record sheet from the CIA, dated September 19, 1974, concerning the manuscript and galley proof of E. Howard Hunt's book, "Undercover: Memoirs of an American Agent." Seymour R. Bolten is the sender, and Mr. John Morrison of the Office of General Counsel (OGC) is the recipient.

The document details specific passages in the galley proof that the CIA wants deleted or revised for security reasons. A DDO panel has designated items 12, 14, 19, 21, 24, and 25 as "hard core," meaning the Agency is prepared to litigate to have them removed.

The reasons for deletion include:

*   Protecting the identities of individuals who retired under cover, such as Henry Pleasants, John Richardson, Rutherford T. "Pinky" Walsh, and Frank Holcomb.
*   Concealing CIA operations, including support for anti-communist political operations in Italy, the production and distribution of an animated cartoon based on George Orwell's Animal Farm, subsidizing and distributing "El Campesino's" book, Life and Death in the USSR, and Eudocio Ravines' book, The Yenan Way, and William Buckley's role in that operation as a CIA officer.
*   Protecting sources and methods, such as a CIA-sponsored cover arrangement in Bangkok, the forgery of a page of the Shanghai Post, surreptitious-entry operations, and the acquisition of code materials.
*   Avoiding damage to liaison relationships with foreign services, particularly the British and French, and avoiding disruption to detente efforts with China and relationships with the Japanese.
*   Protecting foreign assets involved in specific operations, such as those in Greece.
*   Avoiding potential harm to individuals, such as Mrs. Marieda Bourgin of the Free Cuba Committee.
*   Addressing potentially misleading statements about CIA alias documentation used by Hunt and others, which could create additional difficulties for the Agency in relation to the "Watergate hearings".
*   Protecting the classified activities of a CIA officer, Roger Goiran.
*   Concerns about the description of the author's contact with Dr. Barney Malloy of CIA.

The document also mentions the FBI's involvement in spotting a possible Soviet intelligence agent, which was then turned over to the Agency. It also mentions the "Ramirez" operation.
