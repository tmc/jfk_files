This document summarizes a Washington Times article about retired KGB agents, specifically the Association of KGB Veterans of Foreign Espionage (FIVA), seeking to sell their memoirs to Hollywood. The article mentions Anatoly Privalov, Oleg Nechiperenko, Anatoly Yazkov (code-named 'Yakovlev'), and Yuri Modin. Nechiperenko claims to have met with Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City in September 1963, prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. Yazkov, who worked out of the Russian Consulate in New York City, was involved in the Soviet Union's atomic bomb espionage.

The document also discusses a potential connection between FIVA's offer and a case involving an individual referred to as "LWOPUS" who provided a manuscript to the agency. The document notes similarities between LWOPUS's situation and FIVA's offer, including the timing, the potential for monetary compensation, the large volume of material, and concerns for safety. The document suggests that LWOPUS's manuscript might be a joint effort or the result of long-term collection of archival material. The document also notes the similarity between the name Yazkov and Yurasov.

The agency is checking the files of the four FIVA officers to determine if they had access to the same information as LWOPUS and if they had contacts similar to those mentioned in the LWOPUS material. The document requests comments from Vilnius.
