This document is a collection of memos and drafts regarding the CIA's experience with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. The act mandated the review and declassification of records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

**Key People and Organizations:**

*   **Warren Commission:** The original commission established to investigate the assassination.
*   **House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA):** A later congressional committee that also investigated the assassination.
*   **Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB):** An independent review board created by the JFK Act to oversee the declassification process.
*   **CIA:** The Central Intelligence Agency, which was required to review and declassify its records.
*   **NARA:** National Archives and Records Administration
*   **DCI Gates:** Former Director of Central Intelligence, who initiated the declassification process.
*   **Russ Holmes:** A DO officer assigned to work on JFK assassination records.
*   **Sylvia Duran:** Individual with information on JMWORLD
*   **William Pawley:** Individual with information on the JFK assassination.
*   **Charles A. Briggs:** Author of one of the memos, involved in the JFK Declassification Project.

**Key Events:**

*   **John F. Kennedy Assassination:** The event that triggered the need for these records.
*   **Passage of the JFK Act (1992):** The legislation that mandated the review and declassification of assassination-related records.
*   **Warren Commission Investigation:** The initial investigation into the assassination.
*   **HSCA Investigation:** A later investigation by the House of Representatives.

**Key Findings and Conclusions:**

*   The CIA's JFK Collection contains a significant amount of duplication and non-JFK related material.
*   The current index of the collection is flawed and contains gaps.
*   Release standards were liberal, with redactions primarily focused on protecting sources, agents, and sensitive operational information.
*   **There is no evidence in the Collection to indicate that the Warren Commission conclusions were wrong.**
*   The JFK Act forced the Agency to review records that should have been opened years ago.
*   The Act imposed unrealistic deadlines, inflexible standards, and procedures, creating a major drain on Agency resources.
*   The ARRB's interpretation of the law led to a time-consuming and labor-intensive review process.
*   The level of evidence required by the Board to postpone information was extremely high.
*   The JFK review effectively shut down other aspects of the Historical Review Program multiple times.
*   The document outlines lessons learned from the JFK review process, including the need for experienced reviewers, clear release strategies, on-site Directorate reviewers, and well-defined declassification guidelines.
*   The ARRB had almost unlimited access to Agency records and personnel.
*   Statutory mandates are not efficient.
*   Requirements to declassify all drives out focus on important.
*   Standards for declassification are invariably different.
*   Projects of equal merit without a statute are orphaned.
*   The need for a proactive, not just reactive, flexible strategy, with corporate Agency direction through the Deputies to their Information Review Officers.
*   Consideration of the need for continued classification of generic versus specific sources and methods information, particularly that already in the public domain and when dealing with matters of high public or historic interest.

The document also includes descriptions of the JFK Collection's contents, including Oswald files, the sequestered collection, DCI morning meeting minutes, Russ Holmes' working files, LA Division JFK Task Force Files, and new assassination records.
