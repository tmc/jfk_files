This document is a secret CIA message from the Director to Mexico and Rome, concerning "DESIGNET" (IDEN A), a former long-term resident of "PERUMEN," who will be revisiting on a business trip for "IDEN B." DESIGNET is associated with a firm and will depart Italy on October 6th, visit friends in Switzerland, then proceed to Madrid to take an Iberia flight directly to PERUMEN on October 11th. After approximately two weeks, DESIGNET will attempt to exit PERUMEN for a debriefing/briefing by "KUBARKER" before potentially returning to PERUMEN for a few more months. The message also mentions that Rome will contact Mexico City to arrange passage for DESIGNET prior to his departure, and that "KQS" is forwarding full details of this operation to Mexico.
