**Summary:**

This document discusses the impending release of classified documents related to Lee Harvey Oswald under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. The (Copenhagen) Station is reviewing the material, which includes a cover sheet, a one-page cable stating "no traces," and the first page of a Director cable requesting traces on Oswald. The Station believes that unless the missing portions of the Director cable are relevant to Denmark, they cannot argue against the release, but they insist that crypts be deleted. They request to be informed of the release date to notify the Ambassador and liaison service chiefs.
