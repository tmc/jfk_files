This document is a SECRET message, dated November 14, 1977, from the CIA Director to Lisbon, London, Mexico City, and other recipients. It concerns the U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations' (HSCA) investigation into the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King.

**Key Points:**

*   The HSCA, led by G. Robert Blakey (Chief Counsel and Staff Director), intends to pursue leads in Portugal, the UK, and Mexico related to James Earl Ray, who was convicted of murdering Martin Luther King.
*   The HSCA is interested in Ray's brief presence in Lisbon in May 1968, shortly before his apprehension in London in June 1968.
*   Blakey wants to establish a "cordial relationship" with Portuguese National Police, access their files, and interview potential witnesses.
*   The CIA is cooperating with the HSCA by providing access to Directorate records (suitably sanitized).
*   The CIA believes that interviewing police and witnesses is best handled by Legats or others who can be publicly quoted or identified.
*   Stations are expected to advise embassies if solicited but should avoid involving station officers in negotiations. If unavoidable, HQS should be advised.
