This document is a memorandum from Austin M. Jones, C/TSD/CAB/SD, to the Chief of the Special Affairs Staff (SAS), attention Mr. A. Rodriquez, dated January 3, 1964, regarding radio switch equipment for demolition firing purposes.

**Key Points:**

*   **Subject:** Radio switch equipment for demolition firing purposes.
*   **Consultations:** Jones consulted with Mr. Jay Alpern (TSD/AOB) and Mr. Lee Poole (TSD/QRF) regarding the equipment.
*   **Recommended Companies:** Motorola (Chicago, Illinois) and Kell (Cambridge, Massachusetts) are recommended as sources for reliable equipment, having experience with classified contracts with TSD. Motorola developed VHF radio switch equipment for demolition for TSD. Kell produced transistorized sets for other SAS projects (not for demolition).
*   **Frequencies:** TSD recommends VHF/UHF spectrum with crystal tuning control for reliability and signal rejection.
*   **Inexpensive Options:** Inexpensive Japanese or American equipment in citizens band frequencies could be used to produce radio switches with less security against false triggering, with a lead time of 6-8 weeks. Counting switches could provide mechanical protection against accidental triggering.
*   **Reliability Factors:** Reliability is difficult to predict due to varying conditions like antenna length, orientation, receiver location, building construction, obstacles, and radio frequency interference.
*   **Recommendations:** A conference with audio technicians or engineers is recommended to clarify equipment characteristics. Camouflaging explosives is a minor consideration compared to the effects on the receiver switch.

**People:**

*   Austin M. Jones (C/TSD/CAB/SD)
*   A. Rodriquez (Mr.)
*   Jay Alpern (TSD/AOB)
*   Lee Poole (TSD/QRF)

**Organizations:**

*   CIA (Central Intelligence Agency)
*   SAS (Special Affairs Staff)
*   TSD (Technical Services Division)
*   AOB (Audio Operations Branch)
*   QRF (Quick Reaction Facility)
*   Motorola (Chicago, Illinois)
*   Kell (Cambridge, Massachusetts)

**Events:**

*   Discussion on December 30 (presumably 1963) regarding radio switch equipment.

**Conclusions:**

*   Reliable radio switch equipment for demolition firing purposes can be obtained from Motorola or Kell.
*   VHF/UHF frequencies are recommended for reliability.
*   Inexpensive options exist but offer less security.
*   Reliability is affected by various environmental factors.
*   Further consultation with audio technicians/engineers is recommended.
