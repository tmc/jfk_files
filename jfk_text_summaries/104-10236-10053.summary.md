This document is a classified message dated October 11, 1962, concerning the potential establishment of an AMBUD delegation in Jamaica.

**People:**

*   Frank (DIAZ) Silveira

**Organizations:**

*   AMBUD
*   RUABBE Service
*   Cuban Consulate
*   "Friends of Cuba Committee"
*   Socialist Party of Jamaica
*   KUBARK
*   ODYOKE

**Nations:**

*   Jamaica
*   Cuba

**Religious Groups:**

*   Ras Tafaris

**Events:**

*   Caribbean Games
*   Cold War

**Conclusions:**

*   The COS (Chief of Station) believes the Jamaican government wants to avoid overt involvement in the Cold War due to concerns about the safety of the large Jamaican community in Cuba.
*   The Jamaican government will help covertly where possible, but any attempt to involve them against their will would be counterproductive.
*   The Station values increasing cooperation from the RUABBE Service in Cuban objectives.
*   The Station would reluctantly agree to an AMBUD representative visiting Jamaica during the Caribbean Games with Frank (DIAZ) Silveira, but insists on no public announcements beforehand.
*   If the Jamaican government rejects AMBUD after advance publicity, it would be a major victory for the Cuban Consulate and a boost to the "Friends of Cuba Committee" and the "Socialist Party of Jamaica."
*   The COS believes it is advantageous for KUBARK and ODYOKE for AMBUD to stay out of Jamaica until sentiment changes, as the Station could not plausibly deny responsibility for AMBUD to RUABBE and the government opposes the use of Jamaica for counter-revolutionary purposes against Cuba.
