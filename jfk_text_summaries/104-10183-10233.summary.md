This document is a classified message from the CIA, dated April 4, concerning a proposed operation (OP) involving audio targeting against "UNSNAFU/19". The message discusses the risks to a (LIAISON) equity due to unretrievable equipment and suggests alternative possibilities, including an inductive tap on present UNSOX wires. It mentions "HEFAIRY" and "UNION" retaining contact with "UNBOX 8".
