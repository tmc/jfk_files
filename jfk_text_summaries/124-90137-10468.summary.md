This document details a 1961 FBI communication regarding a potential collaboration between the CIA and a Cuban national, Jorge Beliard, referred to as "[PSI]". The CIA believes PSI, who is the Station Manager of Cubana Airlines in New York City, could assist in establishing courier routes between the U.S. and Cuba due to his position and contacts. The FBI is considering three options: refusing CIA contact, allowing CIA to operate independently, or acting as an intermediary. The FBI directs the New York office to discreetly contact PSI to determine his willingness and capability to assist, without revealing the CIA's involvement. The New York office has been developing PSI as a source since November 1960, and he has provided information on Cubana Airlines operations and personnel, including flight manifests. The CIA has agreed to wait for FBI approval before contacting PSI. The FBI wants to assess PSI's potential value to the CIA before deciding on a course of action.
