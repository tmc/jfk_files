This document is a dispatch from the Chief of the WE Division to the Chief of Station in Mexico City, dated October 23, 1963, concerning LIENVOY-8. The dispatch reveals that LIENVOY-8, believed to have been terminated from the LIFEAT and LIENVOY Project, is still listed under the LIENVOY Project. In February 1960, LIENVOY-8, described as a "sour" nationalist, caused a security problem by requesting a transfer to his parent organization, the General Staff of the Presidency, due to his disapproval of ODTOKE's sharing of the LIENVOY take. Headquarters notes that LIENVOY-8's clearance was never cancelled, and there is no termination report in his file. The Station is requested to provide LIENVOY-8's current status, an Agent Service Record if terminated, or a current analysis of his reliability and any security problems if still being used.
