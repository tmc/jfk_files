This document is a SECRET message, dated August 12, 1995, concerning a draft briefing paper and the Lee Harvey Oswald files.

**Key Points:**

*   **Lee Harvey Oswald Files:** An offer to provide the Lee Harvey Oswald files was turned over to the FBI due to the sensitivity connected with the Kennedy assassination. The sender is querying the FBI for an update.
*   **Briefing Paper Edits:** Instructions are given to correct a draft briefing paper, specifically requesting the deletion or softening of certain points before it is presented to a Senator.
    *   Unilateral operations should not be discussed with the Senator.
    *   A paragraph about Embassy security in Minsk should be redrafted to emphasize the lack of an effective deterrent to surreptitious entry without a 24-hour presence. The State Department's funding limitations regarding Marine guards are mentioned, and alienating Ambassador NWBolton is to be avoided.
