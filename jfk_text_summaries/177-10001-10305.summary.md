This document is a CIA memorandum, dated March 27, 1963, concerning the Cuban training of Latin American subversives. It estimates that 1,500 to 2,000 Latin Americans have received guerrilla training or political indoctrination in Cuba. The document records the travel of 5,059 Latin Americans to Cuba in 1962, and at least 417 in the first two months of 1963.

**Key Points:**

*   **Cuban Training:** Cuba is actively training Latin Americans in guerrilla warfare and political subversion.
*   **Recruitment:** Trainees are selected by leftist organizations, not always Communist, and screened by Cuban embassies.
*   **Travel:** Travel to Cuba is concealed through falsified documents, circuitous routes, and detachable visas. Mexico is a key transit point.
*   **Training Content:** Training includes weapons, tactics, political indoctrination, sabotage, and espionage. Che Guevara's book on guerrilla warfare is used.
*   **Countermeasures:** Latin American security services are often unable to establish Cuban connections to arrested subversives.
*   **Propaganda:** Cuba uses Radio Havana and Prensa Latina to spread propaganda throughout Latin America.
*   **Country-Specific Information:** The document includes detailed annexes on Cuban training activities in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
