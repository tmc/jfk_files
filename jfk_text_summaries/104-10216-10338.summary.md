This document discusses a situation involving individuals with code names UNSNAFU/9 and UNSNAFU/19, and the potential implications for AMLASH/1. The Director instructs the Paris office to investigate UNSNAFU/19's statement that UNSNAFU/9 was a "dirty KUBARK agent." The plan involves using AMWHIP/1, upon arrival in Paris, to cautiously determine the basis of the accusation. AMWHIP/1 is then instructed to contact Jose Iglesias, a jeweler friend in Havana, under the guise of a business matter, to relay information about the UNSNAFU/9 incident to AMLASH/1. The Director believes this method is secure and faster than sending a letter. The Paris office is instructed to advise if AMWHIP/1 feels this method is unsafe. The document also mentions the need to keep headquarters informed on all aspects of this matter.
