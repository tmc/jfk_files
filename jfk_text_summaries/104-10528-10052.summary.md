This document, dated September 1963, discusses a plan involving an individual named DESIGNET (IDZN A), a former long-term resident of PERUMEN, who is on a business trip for IDEN B, representing the firm ANCNG. DESIGNET will depart Italy on October 6th to visit friends in Suisse, then proceed to Iberia, arriving in PERUMEN on October 11th. The plan involves DESIGNET exiting PERUMEN approximately two weeks after arrival for a debriefing/briefing by KUBARIKER in TRIΓ ΧΙ, with the hope of returning to PERUMEN for two or three months. KIRA MISKOLCAPLE, a Rome contact, is arranging passage for DESIGNET prior to his departure through ARCANEAN ENTE. The document requests that DESIGNET contact Mexico City for a brief exit. The message is addressed to MEXICO, ROME, and WAVE, and originates from the DIRECTOR.
