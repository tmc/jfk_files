This document is a draft memorandum from William Harvey to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), dated November 27, 1962, outlining an operational plan for continuing operations against Cuba. The plan was discussed by the Deputy Director (Plans) with the DCI and approved in principle by the DCI, and fully concurred in by the DD/P.

**Summary:**

The memorandum proposes a long-term, high-priority, denied-area type of operation against Cuba, focusing on intelligence gathering, isolating and discrediting the Castro regime, and maintaining economic and political pressure. It acknowledges the limitations imposed by the U.S. government's assurances against invasion, and the strength of the Castro regime. The plan emphasizes clandestine operations, intelligence collection, and exploitation of potential divisions within the Cuban government and its relationship with the Soviet Bloc. It recommends a reduction in Task Force W expenditures and personnel, the abolition of the operational Mongoose mechanism, and a shift of responsibility for overt support of Cuban exile groups to the Department of State.

*   **Fidel Castro:** Leader of the Cuban regime.
*   **Soviet Union (USSR):** Cuba's primary ally.
*   **Central Intelligence Agency (CIA):** Responsible for carrying out the operations.
*   **Task Force W:** A CIA unit focused on Cuban operations.

**Conclusions:**

*   The U.S. government will give public assurances that, provided no nuclear or offensive weapons are present or re-introduced into Cuba, and provided Cuba does not take action to threaten the peace and security of the Western Hemisphere, the United States does not intend to invade Cuba or support an invasion of Cuba.
*   The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for the indefinite future with its security and control apparatus relatively intact and with the capability not only of crushing unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational conditions in Cuba increasingly difficult.
*   The United States assurances of no invasion and no support of an invasion will, in effect, constitute giving to Castro and his regime a certain degree of sanctuary. This will severely damage the morale and motivation of anti-regime Cubans both inside and outside of Cuba, which will make it increasingly difficult for us to recruit agents, maintain agents already recruited, and continue or intensify our intelligence and other efforts against Cuba and the Castro-communist regime.
*   The so-called "Track Two" course of action, 1.e., unlimited support of Cuban exiles and exile groups with no real control or objective purposes in the hope that these groups will be able to shake the Castro regime will, although unrealistic, become increasingly attractive at various levels in the United States Government.
*   Paramilitary, commando and sabotage operations, except in rare selective instances will serve little purpose; also they will be counter-productive since, if undertaken, they will make the collection of intelligence more difficult and should only be undertaken in those very few instances where an unusually high return can be demonstrated.
*   An increased use of facilities, real estate and basing outside the United States, particularly in Latin America, will be both necessary and desirable.
*   The memorandum recommends a shift in strategy towards long-term intelligence gathering and clandestine operations, while acknowledging the limitations imposed by U.S. policy and the strength of the Castro regime.
