This document is a communication from the Director to PARIS/LCPIPTI, with information for MEXICO CITY and CA/2, CA/PESCA 2, regarding the Latin America Study Seminar (LASS). The key individuals and groups involved are:

*   **Manuel Kragpr:** Sender of the message.
*   **KORNELOS and AYZIA:** Briefed on TASS SPATENY and CAIR.
*   **CORDERO:** Briefed on the outlined thinking.
*   **FEUU:** Blamed for failure to hold an event.
*   **COSEC:** Tasked with seeking another site for the event and receiving support for a literacy seminar.
*   **SUPCOM (Sept Supervision Committee):** Authorized the COSEC letter.
*   **UFUCH:** Coordination needed to avoid their active hostility towards LASS.
*   **MEXI Station:** Operations should not conflict with the event.

The document discusses the possibility of holding the LASS, outlining conditions under which it should or should not be held. The conditions include:

*   Minimum participation of 7 democratic unions with clear evidence against extremists.
*   Coordination with UFUCH to avoid hostility.
*   Likelihood that LASS can be used for democratic expression.
*   No conflict with MEXI station operations.
*   Absence of well-organized extremist counteraction.
*   The effort not becoming a counterproductive diversion of resources.

The document also discusses potential strategies for withdrawing the invitation or postponing the LASS if necessary. The Director believes it unlikely that the conditions for holding the event can be met.
