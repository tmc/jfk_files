This document is a memo from the FBI to the CIA, dated April 10, 1963, regarding FRANC PECAR, a commercial representative from Yugoslavia. The FBI is responding to information received from the CIA that an individual with the same last name as Pecar was a member of the Yugoslav Intelligence Service (YIS), although another CIA source disputes this. The CIA has learned that Pecar is supposedly being recalled to Yugoslavia but wishes to remain in the U.S. The CIA desires verification of this information because if it is true CIA may wish to consider contacting subject in an effort to persuade him to return to Yugoslavia under control of CIA. The FBI does not recommend approaching Pecar, citing New York informants who claim he is not engaged in intelligence activities and a recent denial from the State Department for a similar approach. The document also mentions JOSEPH RAYMOND MEROLA.
