**Conclusions:**

*   Casasin wrote a memo about Lee Harvey Oswald after the assassination of President Kennedy because he recognized Oswald's name from State Department information about his time in Minsk and marriage to a Soviet citizen.
*   Casasin believed Oswald was of marginal interest to the CIA and was potentially a "lay-low" Soviet operative.
*   Casasin does not believe Oswald was a CIA operative.
*   Casasin's interest in Oswald was just a lead, and the lack of follow-up was not unusual.
*   Casasin believes it was too risky to monitor Oswald inside the USSR.
*   Casasin does not recall preparing any memo from the time of the conversation referred to in his 1963 memo about interest in Oswald.
*   Casasin believes the 201 Personality form in Oswald's file is passive and not operational.
*   Casasin believes Oswald and Marina got their visas to leave the Soviet Union too easily.
*   Casasin does not preclude the possibility that Oswald was sent back to the United States by the Soviets.
*   Minsk was of interest to the CIA because of special design plants located there.
*   Casasin was opposed to the Legal Travellers Program because it was too short-term to justify the investment of resources and the risk involved.
*   Casasin does not know what the reference to the "Harvey Story" in the last line of his memo referred to.
*   Casasin had never been contacted by anybody, including the Warren Commission, about the memo.
*   Casasin does not know the actual criteria for opening 201's.
*   Casasin mentioned that agency people were assigned to the military base at Atsugi.
*   Casasin does not know what the "AG" notation in the Other Identification block on the form stood for.
*   Casasin could not explain why some of the notations were crossed out and new notations had been made.
*   Casasin thought the Permanent Charge notation meant that the file would stay in the Office of Registry and that the file therefore had no operational significance.
*   Casasin believes from the dispatches he saw on Oswald that they were in a consecutive series as received from the State Department.
*   Casasin does not believe we were able to monitor Oswald inside the USSR.
*   Casasin said if Oswald had revealed secrets he would have been of interest for security.
