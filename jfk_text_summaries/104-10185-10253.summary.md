This document is a classified message from the Director of an organization (likely the CIA, given the context and routing information) to Mexico City, dated May 11, 1964. It concerns the preparation of two documents for a case referenced as "KURIOT" and related to "REF RYBAT." The documents are a driver's license and voter registration. The driver's license requires a full-face negative, name and signature specimen in alias, and date of birth of an asset to be used in the recovery of mail. For the voter registration, "empleado" (employee) is suggested as sufficient for occupation. The documents are to be forwarded via air mail to Travelers Advisory Service in Washington, D.C.
