It details actions taken during September 1963 by various U.S. government agencies, including the Department of State, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Department of Defense, and United States Information Agency (USIA), as part of the Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban Affairs (ICCCA).

**Key Activities and Findings:**

*   **Control of Travel to and From Cuba:** The Department of State worked to thwart Aeroflot's attempts to establish routes to Cuba through North Africa, particularly Algeria and Guinea. They also investigated alleged Cubana aircraft use of facilities in Guadeloupe and expressed concern to the French Government. Efforts were made to tighten controls on Cubana flights to Brazil. The CIA worked to discourage attendance at the Seventh Congress of the International Union (UIA) in Havana by Argentine and Mexican architects.
*   **Control of Clandestine Movement of Guerrillas and Arms:** The Department of State and Department of Defense supported the Honduran Army in locating and eliminating guerrillas in the Patuca River area with U.S. helicopters.
*   **Control of Transfer of Funds:** The Department of State intervened to prevent the sale of surplus Cuban aircraft to a Mexican airline and informed the Department of Treasury about a Miami firm sending remittances to Cuba in violation of regulations.
*   **Strengthening of Counter-Insurgency Capabilities:** The Department of Defense provided counter-insurgency training to Latin American officers in the Panama Canal Zone and deployed mobile training teams to several Latin American countries. The CIA recruited a former member of a guerrilla group in Guatemala and agreed to furnish the Peruvian Investigations Police with an outboard motor to increase their patrol capability on rivers crossing the Bolivian frontier.
*   **Exchange of Intelligence on Cuban Subversion:** CIA Stations exchanged intelligence with local intelligence agencies in Argentina, Colombia, and Peru.
*   **Other Special Actions:** The USIA transmitted articles relating to Cuban subversion to USIS offices throughout Latin America and broadcast news analyses and commentaries on the Voice of America. The CIA assisted in the defection of a Cuban athlete in Brazil and provided assistance to the Government of Guatemala in the interrogation of individuals connected to confiscated Communist Party documents.
