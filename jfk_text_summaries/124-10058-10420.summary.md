This document is an FBI record dated June 23, 1964, concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas. The information was provided by Mr. R.E. Carter of the CIA in London, who obtained it from a tisur (source) within the Cuban Embassy in London, operated by British Security Service, MI-5 and British Secret Intelligence Service, MI-6.

The information comes from a conversation on May 8, 1964, between Mariotriva Patterson, Counselor at the Cuban Embassy in London, and an unidentified male visitor, possibly Colombian. They discussed whether a man named "Foster" (phonetic and indistinct) had ever been to Cuba in connection with the Kennedy assassination. Patterson denied that Foster had been to Cuba, noting he had been refused a visa at the consulate in Tampico. The visitor then said, "A typical F.B.I. job," and Patterson responded, "A thing (una cosa) of the Imperialists to kill him in the end really disgusting."

The FBI speculates that "Foster" may have been Lee Harvey Oswald.
