This document is a memorandum dated April 9, 1962, from Victor R. White, Deputy Director of Security (Investigations and Operational Support), to the Chief of the Technical Services Division, specifically addressed to Mr. John Swedberg. The subject is James Paul Olds.

The memo confirms a verbal request made on April 5, 1962, for the preparation of alias documentation for Olds under an unspecified alias. This documentation includes a California Driver's License, Social Security card, Reserve Officers Association identity card with the rank of Commander, and an insurance identity card.

The memo specifies that Swedberg was provided with Olds' true name, photograph, signature sample, and physical description (Blue eyes, Brown hair, 6'3" height, 200 lbs weight, Ruddy complexion, and a birthdate of February 19, 1917, in Elmhurst, New York). He was instructed to use a non-backstopped, multiple unit address in San Francisco.

The documentation was to be ready by 1600 hours on April 6, 1962, and would be returned to the Technical Services Division when Olds no longer needed it.
