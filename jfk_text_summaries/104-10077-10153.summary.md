**Summary:**

This document details the termination of the ZEPRIMA program due to its failure to achieve significant results. The program aimed to recruit technicians from Western Europe for Cuba, but fell far short of its objective. The reasons for the failure include the Cuban Foreign Ministry and Foreign Service officers' reluctance to aggressively pursue tech recruiting, bureaucratic incompetence in Havana, fear of hostile agent infiltration, and a loss of interest from Fidel Castro. Despite the program's failure, stations are urged to remain alert for opportunities to place resident agents in Cuba.
