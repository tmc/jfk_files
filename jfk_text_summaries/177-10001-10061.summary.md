This document is a CIA report, dated December 13, 1963, regarding the alert status of Cuban diplomatic missions following the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The report, classified as SECRET with dissemination controls, indicates that approximately two days after Kennedy's assassination, Cuban diplomatic missions abroad received messages placing them on high alert. This was due to the Cuban government's apprehension that the circumstances surrounding the assassination might lead to hostile activity against the missions.
