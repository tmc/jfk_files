This Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) telegram, dated October 24, 1961, reports on statements made by Manolo Ray, an exile leader of the Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP - People's Revolutionary Movement). Ray stated in early October 1961 that he opposed any invasion of Cuba, believing that Fidel Castro's overthrow should be achieved through internal resistance, which he claimed had already begun. He asserted that the MRP was organized throughout Cuba, supported by all classes, and had members in trade unions, the G-2, the militia, and the administration. Ray estimated that 80% of the Cuban population opposed Castro, and that the MRP had more support than the original revolution had. The information was obtained from an official British service source with good contacts among exiles in Caracas.
