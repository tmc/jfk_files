This document outlines the "201 system" used by the Operations Directorate of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for identifying, controlling, and filing information on persons of interest.

**Key Aspects of the 201 System:**

*   **201 Number:** A unique identifier assigned to each individual in the system.
*   **201 Dossier:** The official file containing biographical information, references, and other pertinent data on the individual.
*   **Master 201 Record:** A machine record generated when a 201 file is opened, used for indexing and special listings.
*   **Main Index Master 201 Reference:** A reference printed in response to an Index Search Request.
*   **OI Code:** A two-letter symbol used to record an individual's association with organizations or activities of operational interest (e.g., intelligence or security service affiliation).
*   **201 Machine Lists:** Lists produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on names or other identifying information.

**Procedures:**

*   **Opening a 201 Dossier:** The prerogative of an operational component, in coordination with the Information Services Group (ISG). Dossiers are opened on subjects of extensive reporting, CI investigation, prospective agents, members of target organizations, or those with a large volume of correspondence.
*   **Contents of the Dossier:** Includes biographical information, photographs, fingerprints, operational approvals, name check replies, contracts, training records, newspaper clippings, and any information relevant to understanding the subject.
*   **Maintenance of 201 Dossiers:** Includes purging outdated or duplicate material, classifying documents, and ensuring proper filing procedures.
*   **201 Dossier Charges:** Dossiers can be kept on permanent charge at a desk during periods of active interest.
*   **Restricted Dossiers:** Access to sensitive 201 dossiers can be restricted.
*   **Requests for Information:** The Automated Index Section (IP/AIS) provides information on 201 personalities, unless the file is restricted.
*   **201 Dossier Cancellation:** Files can be authorized for cancellation by a Records Officer.
*   **201 Machine Listings:** Provide names and 201 numbers based on geographic or functional areas of interest. Listings can be standard (alphabetical, numerical, by cryptonym) or non-standard (based on country of location, OI codes, citizenship, year of birth, occupation).

The system relies on a combination of manual filing and mechanized indexing, with strict procedures for opening, maintaining, restricting, and canceling dossiers.
