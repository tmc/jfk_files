This document is a CIA report, dated October 9, 1963, concerning a potential Government of Vietnam (GVN) plot. The report, based on information from a medium-level GVN official named Nguyen Duy Bach, alleges that the GVN was planning to allow a student demonstration in front of the American Embassy in Saigon. Under the cover of this demonstration, approximately 100 GVN agents would attack the embassy, assassinate Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, other high-ranking embassy officials (including Melvin L. Manfull, Frederick W. Flott, and John M. Dunn), and Buddhist leader Thich Tri Quang, who was residing in the chancery. The agents would then set the chancery on fire. The report also mentions Ngo Dinh Nhu and Ngo Trong Hieu. The CIA viewed the student demonstration aspect of the report as plausible, but was skeptical of the other aspects. The report was disseminated to Ambassador Lodge, General Harkins (USMACV), CINCPAC, PACAF, ARPAC, and PACFLT.
