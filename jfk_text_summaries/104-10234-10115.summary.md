This document discusses a CIA operation involving several individuals and locations in Europe. Here's a summary:

**People and Organizations:**

*   **AMWEST/1:** Approached by KUBARK (CIA) for recruitment in April 1965 but refused after a trip to Paris in August 1965.

*   **MANGANELLO (M):** CIA contact in Bonn, maintaining contact with AMWEST/2.
*   **ANTONIO CARRILLO:** To meet with AMWEST/1 in Geneva. AMWEST/1 is concerned about a possible reassignment since he is not a favorite of Carrillo and was a friend of AMLASH/1.
*   **AMLASH/1:** Individual with past associations to AMWEST/1, AMWEST/2, and CARRILLO.
*   **AMWHIP/2:** (Identified in Bonn only) Wife of ROME asset AMWHIP-1.

**Locations:**

**Events:**

*   AMWEST/1 was approached for recruitment by KUBARK in April 1965 but refused after a trip to Paris in August 1965.
*   AMWEST/1 is scheduled to meet with ANTONIO CARRILLO in Geneva.

**Concerns and Conclusions:**

*   The CIA is interested in recruiting or defecting AMWEST/1.
*   There is concern that AMWEST/1's meeting with CARRILLO could be a provocation attempt, given the past associations with AMLASH/1 and the current relationship between AMWEST/1 and CARRILLO.
*   There are concerns about the safety of AMWHIP/2's wife during her trip to PBRUMEN due to her past business association with AMLASH/1.
*   The CIA suggests no contact between the AMWESTs and AMWHIPs.
*   The CIA requests a report on the details of the AMWEST/1-CARRILLO meeting to determine AMWEST/1's future status and resolve the provocation question.
*   The CIA is interested in AMWHIP/2's potential contact with a high-level PBRUMEN military friend during her trip.
