This document is a CIA information report, dated August 14, 1962, concerning the alleged views of the British Ambassador to South Vietnam, H.A.F. Hohler, on a neutralist solution for South Vietnam. The report is based on information from a Vietnamese journalist who spoke with Hohler.

**Key People:**

*   **H.A.F. Hohler:** British Ambassador to South Vietnam.

*   **Frederick E. Nolting:** U.S. Ambassador.
*   **Burrows:** Counsellor of the British Embassy in Saigon.
*   **Henry Lee:** Colonel, Military Attache to the British Embassy.

**Conclusions:**

*   The report suggests that Ambassador Hohler may believe a neutralist coalition government is the only solution for South Vietnam and that the Americans cannot win the war against the Vietnamese Communists.
*   However, the CIA source appraisal casts doubt on whether Ambassador Hohler actually holds these views.
*   Other British Embassy staff members, Burrows and Colonel Henry Lee, expressed critical views of the Diem government and the progress of the war.
*   Ambassador Nolting stated that Hohler has never indicated that he holds the views attributed to him in this report.
*   Ngo Dinh Nhu believes that French policy aims for the neutralization of South Vietnam and Southeast Asia, while British policy is more aligned with that of the US.
