*   **Photo Experiments:** Experiments with filters and speed settings to improve photo quality affected by traffic air pollution.
*   **Proposed Combination with KDVAULT:** Consideration of combining the KDFACTOR photo operation with the KDVAULT technical operation.
*   **Security Review:** Headquarters conducted a favorable security review of KDFACTOR.
*   **Termination of KDFACTOR Project:** Due to developments reported in other channels, the project was terminated.

*   The project was terminated due to unspecified developments.
