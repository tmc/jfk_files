This document is a memo from the CIA to the Department of State, dated August 16, 1963, regarding Henryk Ignacy Janikowski, born September 4, 1921, in Wiele, Bydogoszcz, Poland. The memo details information obtained from a West German service investigation into Erik Schott, an architect in Bremen, West Germany. Schott was interrogated due to a $1,000 check from Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto of the Mexican Embassy in Moscow being deposited into his account.

Schott stated that Janikowski asked him to buy used cars and ship them to him in Poland, sending dollars and dollar checks via a Polish sailor, obtained from the black market and exhibitors at the Poznan Fair. Janikowski also purchased cars in Belgium and a Renault in Germany, using a false statement to avoid customs duty. In 1959, Janikowski told Schott he could obtain dollars from "an employee of an embassy" in exchange for zlotys at the black market rate. Schott's wife stated that checks arrived by mail from an employee of the Mexican Embassy in Warsaw, Poland, which her husband deposited in Schott's account. The Mexican Ambassador in Warsaw, Eduardo Espinosa y Prieto, sent a check for $1,000 for deposit to the account of Erich Schott. Janikowski also mentioned a past investigation by Polish authorities due to having dollars in his house. In 1961, Janikowski visited Schott and traveled to Belgium to settle a debt from automobile buying operations in 1957. He also visited his sister in Paris, France, and returned with her to Bremen in a new Peugeot which he had bought in Holland in his sister's name.

The West German service found no evidence that Schott was involved in intelligence activities. The memo was also sent to the FBI.
