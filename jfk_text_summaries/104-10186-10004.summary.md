This document is a classified message from November 3, 1963, originating from Montevideo, Uruguay. It is addressed to the Director, Santiago, JMWAVE, and Rio de Janeiro.

The message discusses a request to have AMMUG-1 visit Montevideo to give a presentation similar to one given in Santiago (reference Santiago 5331). The message requests an evaluation of AMMUG-1's potential impact, both as a person and the timeliness of his information, for a presentation before the Minister of Interior and Chief of AVALANCHE.

The message suggests that such a briefing might assist in convincing the need for YM support for a newly created Directorate of Intelligence unit and five AVALANCHE officers soon to return from WOFIRM training.
