This document is a memorandum from Daniel J. Hogan, dated June 10, 1964, detailing tests conducted on modified sights for the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) Rifle on June 2, 1964. The tests were performed at Isolation with the assistance of James Barb and Glen Winstead.

**People:**

*   **Daniel J. Hogan:** Author of the memorandum.
*   **Donald R. Dunn:** From TSD/EB, participated in the tests.
*   **James Barb:** From Isolation, assisted with the tests.
*   **Glen Winstead:** From Isolation, assisted with the tests.
*   **Cal Hicks:** C/WH/SA/MCR/FIN

**Organizations:**

*   **TSD/EB:** Technical Services Division/Engineering Branch

*   **CIA** (Implied, based on document markings and context)

**Events:**

*   **Tests of Modified Sights:** Tests were conducted on a Williams Peep sight and a Japanese-made telescopic sight for the 7.62 Belgium (FAL) Rifle.
*   **Williams Peep Sight Test:** The Williams sight was tested at ranges from 25 to 130 yards using both underloaded and full load rounds. Results were erratic.
*   **Telescopic Sight Test:** The telescopic sight test was aborted due to the inability to mount the scope firmly and maintain a proper zero.

**Conclusions:**

*   The scope and mount are recommended to be discarded.
*   The Williams sight is acceptable, but the number of clicks per revolution of the knob should be reduced.
*   Further testing of the underloaded ammunition is recommended to determine the reasons for the erratic performance. The blackening of the case necks suggests low pressures and a poor seal. It is recommended to turn the gas port to the off position and investigate soft annealing case necks.
