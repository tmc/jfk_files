This document is a memorandum detailing tests conducted on an open sight hood for the 7.62mm Belgium (FAL) Rifle, along with tests of improved underloaded 7.62mm NATO rounds. The tests were conducted by the undersigned (Daniel J. Bogan) and Mr. Bob Ricker of TSD/SDB on June 15 and 16, 1964.

**Key People:**

*   **Daniel J. Bogan:** TSD/EB, author of the memorandum and participant in the tests.
*   **Bob Ricker:** TSD/SDB, participant in the tests.

**Organizations:**

*   **TSD/SDB:** Technical Services Division/???? Branch
*   **TSD/EB:** Technical Services Division/???? Branch
*   **WH/SA/MOB/PM:** A branch within the CIA, likely involved in weapons procurement and modification.
*   **AMF Sound Lab:** Used for sound level measurements.
*   **CIA:** Central Intelligence Agency
*   **DDP:** Deputy Director of Plans

**Equipment & Technology:**

*   **7.62mm Belgium (FAL) Rifle:** The primary weapon being tested.
*   **Open Sight Hood:** A snap-on sight developed for the FAL rifle to improve shooting in poor light.
*   **Williams Peep Sight:** An alternative sight previously tested.
*   **Underloaded 7.62mm NATO rounds:** Modified ammunition with soft, annealed cases and cream of wheat filler.
*   **Muzzle Attachment Silencer:** Used in conjunction with the underloaded ammunition.
*   **.22 Caliber Hi-Standard pistol with folding shoulder stock and Bushnell 1.3X Phantom scope:** Used for comparison in low-light conditions.

**Events & Findings:**

*   **Open Sight Hood Testing:** The open sight hood was tested for ease of use and effectiveness in various lighting conditions. It was found to be comparable to the peep sight under ideal conditions but more difficult to maintain uniform vertical grouping.
*   **Improved Ammunition Testing:** The improved ammunition showed consistent performance, and the cream of wheat filler appeared to improve ignition.
*   **Low-Light Testing:** The scope-equipped pistol was superior to both the peep sight and open sight in low light, as long as there was some illumination. The open sight was effective at closer ranges in dusk conditions. No muzzle flash was visible from the underloaded ammunition and silencer combination.
*   **Listener Trials:** The mechanical noise of the rifle and the sound of the round being fired could be heard at approximately 275 yards downwind.
*   **Silencer Clogging:** The cream of wheat filler caused residue buildup in the silencer, increasing the duration of the noise but not the overall noise level.
*   **Sight Hood Fit Issues:** The sight hood did not fit all FAL rifles due to variations in rear sight thickness. The solution was to provide small files for adjustment.
*   **Scope Availability:** A scope for the 7.62mm Belgium (FAL) Rifle (Sniper Version) was discovered to be available in the Agency supply system and steps were being taken to obtain one for evaluation.

**Conclusions:**

*   The open sight hood is a viable option for improving shooting in poor light, but requires familiarization and may need adjustment to fit different rifles.
*   The improved underloaded ammunition shows promise for consistent performance and reduced muzzle flash.
*   The cream of wheat filler in the ammunition can clog the silencer, potentially increasing the duration of the sound.
*   A scope may be a better option for low-light shooting if available.
