This memorandum discusses the Movimiento Democratica Cristiano, an anti-Castro group, and its connection to Bela Kiraly of the Hungarian Freedom Fighters Inc., a CA-sponsored activity. James Condon of CA requested security information on the organization and Laureano BATESTI falla (212 635), the writer of a letter from the organization to Kiraly. The purpose was to determine if Kiraly could assist the group. Security records revealed the organization's anti-Castro stance and BATESTI falla's previous involvement with the Agency under an Operational Approval in 1960.
