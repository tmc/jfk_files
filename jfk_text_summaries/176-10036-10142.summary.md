**Summary:**

This CIA information report, dated September 24, 1963, details a planned coup in South Vietnam against President Diem. The report, based on information from Huynh Van Lang, a professor at Saigon University, indicates that the coup was planned to occur before October 5, possibly on September 26 or 28. The Revolutionary Committee involved includes Generals Tran Thien Khiem, Nguyen Khanh, and Duong Van Minh, with General Do Cao Tri also participating. The coup aims to be relatively bloodless, but a major problem is the lack of suitable explosives to breach a bunker where President Diem is expected to hide. The report outlines the forces involved, including divisions, airborne, marine, and armor elements, and the roles of various military officers. The timing of the coup is planned to coincide with troop movements for the National Assembly election and National Day parade rehearsals. The report also mentions that the arrival of high-level United States Defense Department officials discouraged the coup group.
