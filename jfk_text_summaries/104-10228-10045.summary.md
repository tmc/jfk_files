This document is a classified message from the Kingston station of an unnamed organization (likely a US intelligence agency) to its Director, dated October 10, 1962. The message concerns the proposed establishment of an "AMBUD" delegation in Jamaica and the Jamaican government's attitude towards it, in the context of the Cold War and Cuban influence.

**Key Points:**

*   **Jamaican Government:** The Jamaican government wants to avoid overt involvement in the Cold War due to concerns for the safety of the large Jamaican community in Cuba. However, they are willing to help covertly.
*   **AMBUD Delegation:** The Kingston station believes that any attempt to involve the Jamaican government against its will regarding the AMBUD delegation would be counterproductive.
*   **RUABBE Service:** The station values increasing cooperation with the RUABBE service in Cuban objectives.
*   **Frank (DIAT) Silveira:** The Jamaican government wanted to expel Frank (DIAT) Silveira for his statements to the press about the proposed AMBUD representation.
*   **Cuban Consulate:** The station fears that a public rejection of AMBUD by the Jamaican government would be a major victory for the Cuban Consulate and groups like the "Friends of Cuba Committee," local communists, Ras Tafaris, and the "Socialist Party of Jamaica."
*   **COS Recommendation:** The COS (Chief of Station) believes it is advantageous for "KUBARK" and "ODYOKE" for AMBUD to stay out of Jamaica until sentiment changes, as the station could not plausibly deny responsibility for AMBUD to RUABBE and the government opposes using Jamaica for counter-revolutionary purposes against Cuba.
*   **C/S Comment:** Suggests sending an "AMEJO" representative to test the local government's climate for the proposed delegation and report the response to AMBUD/1.
