This document, dated May 8, 1961, is a memo from Michael Stratton (WH/4/Reg.) to Mr. Jack Kennedy (WH/L/Security) regarding Court Wood, son of attorney Foster Wood. Stratton reports that Court Wood, who previously expressed anti-Castro sentiments, is now actively organizing a local chapter of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE. He has been meeting with "interested groups" and lecturing to students in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. Students David Lacterman (George Mason High School, Falls Church, VA) and Walt MacDonwald are also involved. Stratton seeks guidance on how to proceed with his relationship with Court and Foster Wood.
