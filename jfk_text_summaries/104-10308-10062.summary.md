**Conclusions:**

*   AMLEO-3 is desperate to rescue his family and is willing to take extreme risks.
*   AMLEO-3 is willing to terminate his relationship with KUBARK to carry out independent exfiltration attempts.
*   The exfiltration attempt was poorly planned and executed.
*   There are inconsistencies in the accounts of the events, likely due to confusion, withholding of information, and the illness of key individuals.
*   The M/V ADA should not be permitted to carry out further family rescue missions to Cuba at this time.
