**Conclusions/Instructions:**

*   Search SI traffic for names of A-9's crewmen or persons caught during the landing period.
*   Wave should attempt to persuade Mrs. A-9 not to try to locate A-9 via Mrs. GPIDEAL or the Mexican President until AMLASH-1 has had time to locate A-9 via AMTRUNK-10.
*   AMLASH-1 should tell AMTRUNK-10 not to try to locate A-9 via the contacts listed, as they may be compromised.
