**Conclusions:**

*   The VC believe that American intervention has postponed their general offensive to liberate SVN.
*   The VC acknowledge that U.S. counterguerrilla tactics have had some success, but believe that indiscriminate killings will push the people toward the revolution.
*   The VC believe that the Front for the Liberation of SVN will gain 90% support from the people due to its "high-sacrifice spirit and its hate-America ideals."
*   The VC are facing difficulties due to U.S. military tactics, but believe the SVN problem will be solved through international politics (a neutralist solution) and internal military measures (strong attacks).
*   VC agrarian reforms have solved the land problem for the peasants and now constitute the food source for the troops and cadres.
