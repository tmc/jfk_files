**Key Issues and Conclusions:**

*   **Mexico City Station:** The CIA wants to protect information about joint tel-tap operations with Mexican services, particularly the cryptonym LIENVOY. They are willing to release information about operations against the Soviet and Cuban embassies, as long as Mexican involvement is concealed.
*   **Release of Station Information:** The CIA is generally opposed to revealing the locations of its stations, arguing it could damage foreign relations, threaten ongoing operations, and undermine trust in the agency's ability to maintain secrecy. They propose using regional designations instead of specific city names.
*   **Specific Stations:** The CIA expresses particular concern about releasing information about stations in the Congo (Zaire), Senegal, Helsinki, Luxembourg, The Hague, Oslo, Madrid, Stockholm, Geneva, Prague, Tokyo, India, Tunisia, and Morocco.
*   **Atsugi, Japan:** References to the CIA base at Atsugi in the context of the U-2 program are deemed releasable.
*   **Negotiations with ARRB:** The CIA is negotiating with the ARRB staff to find compromises on the release of information, including the time period for which stations are "open" and the use of substitutions for station names.
*   **Appeals:** The CIA is preparing to appeal unfavorable determinations by the ARRB and seeks the support of the Department of State.
*   **Impact on Foreign Relations:** The CIA is concerned about the impact of releasing station information on foreign relations and seeks the State Department's assessment.
*   **Importance of Secrecy:** The CIA emphasizes the importance of maintaining secrecy to protect sources, methods, and liaison relationships, and to ensure the agency's ability to conduct intelligence operations effectively.
