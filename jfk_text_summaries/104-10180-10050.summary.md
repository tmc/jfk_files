This memorandum, dated August 3, 1965, concerns an automobile bearing California license HW 810 (with Mexican diplomatic plates D-136). The memo grants permission to include information from a previous memo (dated April 6, 1965) in a report to the Bureau of International Commerce, the Bureau of Customs, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The automobile is reportedly registered to Camilo Domenech Gadea, former Commercial Counselor of the Cuban Embassy who left for Cuba on February 10, 1965. The Cuban Embassy is still using the automobile. The information is from a confidential source in Mexico City and dissemination outside the recipient's office requires prior approval.
