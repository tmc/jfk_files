This document is a dispatch from the Chief of Station, IAVEL/COPY, to the Chief, Special Affairs Staff, regarding a potential WT (Wireless Telegraphy) operator candidate inside a target area.

**Summary:**

In 1960, AMIRE 1 (Peter J. DI CERVENO) recruited a WT operator candidate in Havana, Cuba, initially spotted by AMPANIC-1. The candidate, around 33 years old, had prior experience operating a clandestine WT set for the Organizacion Autentica (OA) against the Batista regime. He was trained by AMELEN-1 in a safehouse obtained by APTOX-1, with CO George D. SCOWCROFT (AMIRD-1's CO) aware of the training. The training included operation of an RS-1, signal plans, coding/decoding, and personal security. The candidate was never activated but kept on standby. AMIRE 1 last contacted him in early 1961, and he was still willing to work. The dispatch requests Headquarters to review files on AMIRD-1, AMELEN-1, or APTOX-1 to ascertain the candidate's identity and current whereabouts to determine his potential operational use. AMPANIC-1 has been terminated due to security weaknesses and should not be contacted.
