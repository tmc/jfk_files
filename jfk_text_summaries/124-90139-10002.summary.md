This document is a memorandum from the FBI, dated October 10, 1963, regarding Manuel Pineiro, a high-ranking official in the Cuban G-2 organization in Havana. The memo, written by Mr. S. J. Papich to Mr. D. J. Brennan, Jr., discusses information received from Mrs. Anita Potocki, a CIA analyst, who believes Pineiro is identical to "Petronio," who has been signing messages to a Cuban Agent in Panama referred to as "Roberto." The CIA came to this conclusion after intercepting communications between Havana and a Cuban Agent in Colombia. The CIA has no objection to the declassification and/or release of CIA information in this document.
