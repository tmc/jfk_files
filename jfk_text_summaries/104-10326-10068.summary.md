**Summary:**

This document is a secret cable from the CIA's LIMIT office in Los Angeles (LA/MCGMXB) to the CIA station in Mexico City, dated September 22, 1995. It concerns a Washington Post article published on the same day, titled "CIA Bugged Soviet Embassy in Mexico City." The article is based on CIA documents declassified under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.

The cable expresses regret that Headquarters (HQS) was unsuccessful in blocking the release of these documents. The main concern is that the article reveals the CIA's wiretap operation in Mexico City, carried out with the cooperation of the Mexican government. The CIA fears this disclosure will damage ongoing operations and erode trust with liaison partners, particularly KDSOMBRERO. The station is requested to provide feedback on any reaction from KDSOMBRERO or unilateral assets to this exposure.
