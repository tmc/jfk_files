**Summary:**

This memorandum details a meeting on May 21, 1965, at National Airport between DiUbaldo (Breitheim) and Subject (AMWHIP-1) regarding the potential placement of AMBUNNY as a French-English-Spanish speaking secretary in UNSNAFU-19's (02) mission in Paris. The initial suggestion stemmed from a casual conversation between Subject and 19 in March 1965. DiUbaldo presented AMBUNNY's qualifications, including her experience as a social secretary for the American Ambassador in La Paz. Subject expressed concerns about concealing AMBUNNY's background from the Cubans. A follow-up meeting was scheduled for May 22 in New York with Subject, AMBUNNY, and Al Marin (alias) to discuss the practicalities. DiUbaldo notes Subject's apparent aging and his tendency to be evasive, suggesting a need to better manage Subject's involvement in the operation.
