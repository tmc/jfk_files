This document is a CIA information report dated August 1963 concerning the planned withdrawal of United Nations troops from the Congo at the end of 1963, despite Congolese Premier Cyrille Adoula's requests to the contrary. The report, sourced from a medium-level Latin American official with contacts in the UN Secretariat, suggests that the only way to prevent the withdrawal would be to find a new method of financing the Congo operation, ideally maintaining 40-50 percent troop strength. The report notes that while there is discussion of funding methods within the UN Secretariat, the Secretary General's ability to accept outside funds is debatable.
