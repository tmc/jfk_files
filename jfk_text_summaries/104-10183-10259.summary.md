This document is a memorandum, dated October 13, 1964, regarding a meeting with Colonel Porres on October 10, 1964, concerning "Operation 06" and a briefing of Colonel Peralta. Andy Rogers of the Guatemalan Station was present at the meeting.

**Key Points:**

*   **Recruitment Targets:** Special attention should be given to the "Caro Astatigo" and the "Chao Hombres Banas" which involved Lyon Sosa, Luis Augusto Turcios Lima, Manuel Jove Ortega Paz, and one unidentified individual. The goal was to identify and recruit all four. A Cuban intelligence officer could be used to contact them under controlled conditions.
*   **Arrest of Cuban-Trained Guerrillas:** The Guatemalan government should locate and arrest individuals (possibly up to 200) who received guerrilla warfare training in Cuba. The arrests should be publicized, and the individuals should be interrogated for propaganda purposes and potential double agent recruitment.
*   **Collaboration:** The Guatemalans should keep the U.S. advised of progress in these cases.
*   **Other Cases:** Colonel Porres discussed the Alfaro Ro case (involving a Mexican courier acting on behalf of Cuban intelligence), the case of Luiz Ramirez, and the case of Hector Jordi Chambonyer.
