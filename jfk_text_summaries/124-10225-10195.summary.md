This document is an intelligence information cable from the CIA, dated January 19, 1965, concerning the cost of mobilization of the Cuban Armed Forces and efforts to economize. The information is based on a report from a highly placed Cuban official who has been considered reliable since February 1964.

**Key Points:**

*   In 1964, the estimated cost of mobilization per man per day to the Cuban government was $5.01 pesos.
*   The 32-day mobilization of 51,000 men in the spring of 1964 reportedly cost the Ministry of the Armed Forces a minimum of $8,176,320 pesos.
*   This mobilization took place before and after May 20, when the Castro government anticipated an invasion attempt by exile forces led by Manuel Ray Rivero.
*   A nine-day mobilization of 17,000 men in late December 1964 and early January 1965 resulted in a minimum cost of an unspecified amount.
