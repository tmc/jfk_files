This document is a memorandum from 1961 detailing a proposal to change the policy for processing potential REDSKIN Agents for the CIA. The proposal involves using a nonofficial cover, specifically Psychological Assessment Associates (used by Dr. GITTINGER), to conduct an A&E (Assessment & Evaluation) assessment of candidates before revealing Agency interest or classified information. If the assessment is favorable, a full security investigation would be conducted, and the candidate would be contacted under alias CIA credentials to perform a mission.

**Events:**

*   No further action is contemplated pending a further request from CCG.
