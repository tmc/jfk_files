**Conclusions and Recommendations:**

*   **CIA's Autonomy:** The CIA has become too autonomous due to an inadequate doctrine of clandestine operations, an inadequate conception of the relationship between operations and policy, and an inadequate conception of the relationship between operations and intelligence.
*   **Doctrine:** The U.S. needs to define the limits of secret activity consistent with the preservation of a free social order.
*   **Operations and Policy:** CIA operations have not been held effectively subordinate to U.S. foreign policy.
*   **Operations and Intelligence:** The relationship between operations and intelligence needs to be re-evaluated to prevent intelligence from being warped by operational biases.
*   **British Model:** The British intelligence system, with its strict Foreign Office control, could be a valuable model.
*   **Reorganization:** Schlesinger proposes a drastic rearrangement of the intelligence set-up, including granting the State Department general clearance authority over all clandestine activity, reconstituting the operating branches of the CIA under a new title (National Information Service), and setting up a second semi-independent agency (Foreign Research Agency) for collation and interpretation.
*   **State Department Overhaul:** If the State Department is not capable of assuming effective command, a drastic overhaul of the State Department is necessary.
