This document is a memo from John Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI, to the CIA's Deputy Director of Plans, dated August 28, 1961. The subject is EDUARDO ESPINOSA Y PRIETO and concerns internal security matters related to Mexico. The FBI is responding to a CIA letter regarding Espinosa's alleged financial support of communist activities.

**Key Points:**

*   The CIA wants to include information in a summary to the Bundesunt fuer Verfassungsschutz (BFV) in Germany, stating that Espinosa wrote bank drafts to active communist workers and may have been used to finance Communist Party activities during his time in New York City.
*   The FBI's review of its files does not support the claim that Espinosa wrote bank drafts to active communist workers, with the possible exception of Alicia Merino Fuentes.
*   The FBI states that the only allegation of Merino Fuentes being an active communist worker was made in 1941 by an unreliable source. The FBI's investigation failed to substantiate this allegation.
*   The FBI points out that Espinosa and Merino Fuentes were both connected with the Mexican delegation to the United Nations when the bank draft was written, which reduces the intelligence significance of the payment.
*   The FBI advises against including the claims about Espinosa's financial support of communist activities in the summary to the BFV.
