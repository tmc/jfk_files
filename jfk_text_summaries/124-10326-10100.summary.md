This document is an FBI memorandum dated April 30, 1954, from W. A. Branigan to A. H. Belmont regarding James Angleton of the CIA. It discusses Angleton's practice of providing information to the FBI outside of regular CIA channels, with the understanding that its origin is protected. Angleton objected to the FBI attributing information to "Confidential Informant T-2, an Agency of the Government which conducts personnel and intelligence investigations" because it could reveal the CIA as the source, especially when the information relates to individuals in Israel. Angleton requested the information be attributed to Confidential Informant T-2, described as being of known reliability. The memo suggests a procedure where Angleton could be referred to as a Bureau informant with a temporary symbol number, linked to his regular Bureau symbol on the informant page. This would allow supervisors to transmit the information to the field, attributing it to a reliable informant.
