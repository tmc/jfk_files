This document is a SECRET message from the CIA, dated September 8, 1964, originating from San Salvador. It references a briefing given to President (likely the President of El Salvador, given the location). The message expresses satisfaction with the presentation but concern over the key role of the CRGE station LE. The station is urged to insist on professional handling, point out security breaches, and demonstrate to Rivera that is incompetent. The message also mentions Cuban subversion and a meeting between the Chief and the El Salvadorian President. The El Salvadorian President desired only local police to be aware of the information presented. A Cuban defector is also mentioned.
