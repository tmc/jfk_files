**Conclusions:**

*   The CIA (likely through KUBARK) made unilateral approaches to Yang Ting-pao and Liang Szu-cheng in Mexico City for assessment, possible debriefing, defection, or recruitment.
*   Yang Ting-pao accepted an interview with a KUBARK staffer.
*   Liang Szu-cheng was approached by a KUBARK-controlled U.S. Sirologist. Liang's attitude was friendly but seemed to follow a prearranged line, professing belief in Chinese Communism.
*   Wu Ching-hsiang's brother, a U.S. citizen, was to meet with him to ask if he wished to remain in the "free world."
*   Rio de Janeiro was requested to monitor the delegation's activities in Brazil and attempt to gather further information.
*   A forced approach to any of the delegation members was not recommended due to concerns about compromising cover and the long-term goal of future follow-up.
*   Mexico City was requested to identify other members of the delegation traveling to Rio de Janeiro and forward any additional information.
