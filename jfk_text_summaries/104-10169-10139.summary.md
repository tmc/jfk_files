**Key Events:**

*   **Defection:** ABLADLE contacted the US authorities in Helsinki and expressed his desire to defect, along with his family.
*   **Initial Evacuation Attempt:** The initial plan was to evacuate ABLADLE and his family from Stockholm to Frankfurt using the Air Attache aircraft. Frankfurt was to have an aircraft ready to immediately transport them to the United States.
*   **Aircraft Issues:** The Air Attache aircraft was found to be in Wiesbaden, not Stockholm, and a C-54 aircraft prepared by EAOB was deemed inadequate.
*   **Failed Flight:** An EAOB aircraft was used, but the flight was aborted due to the defector's daughter becoming airsick.
*   **Safe Housing:** The family was temporarily housed in a safe house in Eschborn.
*   **Commercial Evacuation:** A plan was devised to evacuate the family via a commercial Pan American flight, circumventing German passport control with the help of William Naylor.
*   **Documentation Issues:** There were difficulties in obtaining proper documentation for the family's travel.
*   **Successful Departure:** The family was successfully boarded on the Pan American flight and departed for the United States.
