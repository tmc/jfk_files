This document discusses potential assets and strategies for operations (OPS) targeting PERUNEN in Italy.

**People:**

*   **AMHIP 1:** An asset considered astute with good possibilities for accessing PERUNEN targets in Italy. He travels to Europe, specifically Italy, three to four times annually for business.
*   **CHAS FOA:** Vouched for by AMHIP 1, expects to travel to Rome at least one week per month. He is motivated to help anti-regime activity and is probably persona grata with PERUNEN types.
*   **BELL:** Another possible asset.
*   **IDEN C:** Resides in Suisse.
*   **KUARK:** In Suisse.

**Organizations:**

*   **CIA:** Central Intelligence Agency.
*   **STA:** (Likely a CIA station or unit)
*   **HOS:** (Likely a CIA unit or individual)
*   **KUVEST:** (Likely an organization that can provide cover)
*   **KUBAFX:** (Mentioned in relation to CHAS FOA)
*   **AFX:** (Mentioned in relation to CHAS FOA)
*   **DEVIGIL:** (Mentioned in relation to cover for BELL)

**Nations:**

*   Italy
*   Suisse (Switzerland)

**Events:**

*   Talks with AMHIP 1 in New York.

**Conclusions:**

*   AMHIP 1's routine business matters may occupy a considerable portion of his time in Italy, making him unavailable for immediate operational needs.
*   There are concerns about contaminating AMHIP 1's clean reputation.
*   CHAS FOA is a potential asset due to his frequent visits to Rome and motivation to help anti-regime activity.
*   If STA wishes to check IDEN C out, it is recommended to follow up in Suisse.
*   If IDEN C is unsuitable and STA wishes to proceed with BELL, it is essential to send him to Rome for a test prior to final commitment.
