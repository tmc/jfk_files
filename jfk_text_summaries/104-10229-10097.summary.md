This document consists of two messages from the Director (likely of the CIA) to JMWAVE and WAVE, dated January 14, 1963. Both messages concern the PBRUMEN exiles in Miami and potential intelligence gathering opportunities.

**Message 1:**

*   Concerns two police proposals drafted by PBRUMEN exiles in Miami. The Director deems them unrealistic and premature for official discussion with KUBARK.
*   While a standby PBRUMEN security force is considered important, it's not urgent. The Director doesn't want to encourage further plans that might complicate orderly development and "burn assets."
*   Despite the above, Headquarters is interested in assessing the potential of any asset within PBRUMEN for information collection.
*   SAN JOSE (SJOS) is requested to advise on details regarding IDEN REF B's access to people or data of operational or intelligence value, his security, communications, and tentative contact plan.

**People/Organizations:**

*   **H.F. Swenson:** Originator of the message.
*   **Director:** Sender of the message (likely CIA Director).
*   **J.C. King:** C/WII and C/WHD, Authenticating Officer.
*   **E.A. Marelius:** C/TFG/FI, Coordinating Officer.
*   **PBRUMEN exiles:** Cuban exiles in Miami.
*   **Manuel Perez Borroto:** Ex-Batista police captain, now in Cienfuegos.
*   **KUBARK:** CIA Headquarters.
*   **CIENFUEGOS:** Location in Cuba.

**Locations:**

*   Miami
*   Cuba
*   Costa Rica

**Message 2:**

*   Identifies IDEN REF B as Manuel Perez Borroto, an ex-Batista police captain now in Cienfuegos.

**Conclusions:**

The CIA is interested in using PBRUMEN exiles in Miami for intelligence gathering, but is proceeding cautiously. They are particularly interested in Manuel Perez Borroto and his potential access to information.
