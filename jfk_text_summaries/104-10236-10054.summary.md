This document is a classified message from the CIA station in Jamaica (KNGS) to the Director (DIR) and WAVE (likely a CIA station or department). It discusses the possibility of expanding Cuban coverage from Jamaica, but the COS (Chief of Station) believes an overt delegation, such as one including AMBUD, would be counterproductive due to Prime Minister Bustamante's statement against using Jamaica for counter-revolutionary activities against Cuba, motivated by concerns for the safety of 25,000 Jamaicans in Cuba.

The station has made progress gaining covert support through RUABBE for CI efforts against Cubans, including assistance during the Caribbean Games, but this depends on maintaining covert operations. The COS believes any expansion of activities against Cuba in Jamaica must be covert. They also express concern about public statements by Dr. Frank Diaz Silveira.

The COS is prepared to consider assigning staff or a contract agent to Jamaica under MEXXXX non-official cover to handle Cuban, Haitian, and Dominican problems, but prefers a staffer under official cover to share KUTUBE/KUWOLF general station operations. They emphasize that Cuban coverage has been and will continue to be the focus. They request an additional secretary trained in communications and administration.

The station believes it could increase reporting if a secretary is added to handle administrative chores, given the productive liaison and developing unilateral activities.
