**Events:**

*   **Investigation into the death of President John F. Kennedy:** The HSCA is actively investigating the assassination.
*   **Request for information on 201 files:** The HSCA requests the CIA to provide a detailed statement explaining the criteria for opening a 201 file, particularly during the period 1958-1964.

**Conclusions:**

*   The CIA provides the HSCA with copies of its regulations governing the criteria for opening, maintaining, controlling, and closing 201 files by the Operations Directorate.
*   The CIA suggests that a careful reading of the regulations would answer the HSCA's questions.
*   The CIA provides both the 1960 and 1974 versions of the regulations to reflect the criteria during the period of the HSCA's primary concern (1958-1964) and the later refinements.
*   The 201 system is a method for identifying a person of specific interest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent information about that person.
