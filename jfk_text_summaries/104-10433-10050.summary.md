This document consists of dispatches from an unknown organization, likely a government agency, concerning Martin Luther King, Jr. in March 1966. The dispatches are in response to an inquiry from a Legal Attache in London on March 17, 1966. The organization has no information that King appeared at a rally in Oslo to date, nor does the Embassy have knowledge of a future visit of King to Norway. The Legal Attache desires that the Norwegian authorities not know of the organization's interest in King's activities. The dispatches are classified as SECRET and CONFIDENTIAL.
