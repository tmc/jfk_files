This secret dispatch discusses a potential KGB officer in Germany who was known to AELADLE, the Chief of Base, BUNN. During a meeting with WEYDE and Dr. MEIER, AELADLE mentioned knowing a KGB officer in Germany with similar political views, suggesting Western intelligence should leave him alone as he might defect like AELADLE himself. WEYDE believes the name of the KGB officer might have been AKHLUYEV, who arrived at the STM on 16 February 61 with his wife, is carried by the BFVJAS as an employee of the Trade Mission, and resides within the Trade Mission building. The dispatch suggests querying AELADLE about Soviets assigned in West Germany, particularly those with names starting with "A," to confirm the identity of the individual. The dispatch is from CUS:G, SR, F08 to REDCAP LUIMPROVE.
