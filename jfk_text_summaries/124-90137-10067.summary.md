This document is a memorandum from S.J. Papich of the FBI to Mr. L'Allier, dated September 14, 1960, concerning Petros Moutsos. Moutsos, previously a CIA informant within the communist-dominated Greek Maritime Organization (OENO), is now considered of limited use in that role. The CIA plans to have Moutsos jump ship in New Orleans, with the approval of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and then travel to Cuba to serve as an intelligence source. The CIA hopes Moutsos will re-establish contact with his wife, Angela Boyer, who has a communist background, to aid in establishing contacts within Cuban communist circles. The memo references past correspondence between the FBI and CIA regarding Moutsos. Mrs. Jane Roman of the CIA is mentioned as advising on the matter.
