This document is a memorandum regarding Herbert Itkin and Thomas L. Roberts' affiliations with the CIA and FBI. A meeting was held with Messrs. Rocca, Houston, Warner, and Greaney to discuss the ramifications of a confrontation with the New York FBI office. It was concluded that additional information was required on Thomas L. Roberts and Robert Delson. Ward Greene brought the security files on Roberts and Delson to the office and discussed their contents openly.

Roberts has been a Staff Agent of CIA since 28 August 1961. From March 1964 to November 1964 he spent time in West Africa writing a monograph on West African legal problems under a grant from a foundation which was blown in the MHDOWEL exposures. In November 1964 Roberts was assigned for Cover to the Radio Corporation of America legal staff where he remained until March 1965 and then went to Dakar.

The document questions Roberts' explanation of his affiliation with Itkin and whether Itkin knew of Roberts' affiliation with CIA. CP GLOBE personnel need to determine if Roberts reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva, Switzerland, in March 1966. There is no record of Roberts explaining why he never pursued the Itkin debt or what his financial contribution was to the law firm of Itkin, Roberts & Greenbaum.

Sam Papich of the FBI advised Rocca that the New York District Attorney may be considering prosecution against Robert for having absconded with funds received from negligence cases.

Regarding Robert Delson, there were two operational considerations: Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February 1955, and Project WUBRINY in 1963. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Delson. There are allegations against members of the firm of Delson, Levin and Gordon, indicating that one member of the firm was a card-carrying member of the Communist Party.
