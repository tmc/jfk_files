**Summary:**

This document is a CIA information telegram dated July 17, 1963, concerning a possible shift in the Government of Vietnam's (GVN) foreign policy following the appointment of Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. as the US Ambassador to Vietnam. President Ngo Dinh Diem was reportedly disturbed by Lodge's appointment, interpreting it as a sign that the United States intended to exert more influence. As a result, the GVN recalled several of its diplomats from various countries, ostensibly for a seminar on the Strategic Hamlet Program. However, the real reason was to discuss the GVN's position on the Buddhist situation and to formulate a new foreign policy in light of Lodge's appointment.
