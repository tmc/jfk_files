**Summary:**

This document details the establishment of a live address and cover story for Gladys G. DANBRUNT at the residence of Dr. Edward A. SALLOCM and Anne B. SALLOCM in Cheverly, Maryland, in May 1961. The SALLOCM family was briefed to receive communications (cables, letters, telegrams, phone calls) on behalf of Mrs. DANBRUNT and to provide a cover story that she was residing with them but unavailable. The cover story was that Mrs. DANBRUNT was the mother of Eustace H. DANBRUNT, who was being held prisoner by a foreign government, and she was awaiting a response to a cable she sent him. Dr. SALLOCM notified the Cheverly and Hyattsville Post Offices about Mrs. DANBRUNT's mail. A Western Union telegram was sent to Eustace DANBRUNT in Reclusorio Nacional, Nueva Gerona, Isla de Pinos, Cuba. As of May 24, 1961, no communication had been received for Mrs. DANBRUNT.
