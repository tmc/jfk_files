This document is a request from the CIA's Directorate of Operations to the Moscow station, regarding the Assassination Records Review Board's (ARRB) efforts to obtain records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.

**Key People, Organizations, and Events:**

*   **Lee Harvey Oswald:** The focus of the document is on obtaining KGB files related to him.
*   **President John F. Kennedy:** The assassination is the central event.
*   **Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB):** A board established by Public Law 102-526 in October 1992 with a mandate to identify, secure, and make available all records related to the Kennedy assassination.
*   **Department of State:** Involved in contacting the Russian government to seek disclosure of relevant records.
*   **FSB/SVR:** Russian intelligence agencies (Federal Security Service and Foreign Intelligence Service) that the CIA is considering approaching.
*   **KGB:** The former Soviet intelligence agency, whose records on Oswald are sought.
*   **GRU:** Soviet military intelligence.
*   **Republic of Russia:** The current government that holds the records of the former Soviet Union.
*   **Belarus:** Where the original KGB file on Oswald is stored.
*   **Vice President Gore:** Involved in discussions with Belarus regarding access to the Oswald file.
*   **Rosenbergs:** Mentioned as an example of individuals about whom the Russians might request information in return.

**Summary:**

The ARRB, tasked with declassifying records related to the Kennedy assassination, is seeking access to KGB files on Lee Harvey Oswald. These files were originally in Minsk, moved to Moscow after the assassination, and then returned to Minsk. The ARRB's charter expires on September 30, 1998, making the Oswald file a priority. The Department of State has been engaging with Belarus to obtain the files, but progress has been limited. The ARRB has requested that the CIA station in Moscow contact the FSB/SVR to determine if the Russians retained a copy of Oswald's KGB file and to seek access to it. The CIA is considering the implications of such a request, including potential reciprocal requests from the Russians for information on figures like the Rosenbergs. The CIA is also weighing the potential benefits of assisting the ARRB in obtaining the Oswald file, as it could improve the CIA's negotiating position on other declassification issues. The document seeks input from the Moscow station on the proposed approach.

**Conclusions:**

*   The ARRB is aggressively pursuing all leads related to the Kennedy assassination records.
*   The CIA is hesitant but considering approaching the Russian intelligence agencies for assistance.
*   There are potential risks and benefits associated with engaging the Russians on this matter.
*   The document highlights the ongoing efforts to declassify information related to the Kennedy assassination, even decades later.
