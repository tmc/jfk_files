This document, dated May 10, 1982, discusses VALERIY VLADIMIROVICH KOSTIKOV, a KGB officer.

**Summary:**

The document concerns VALERIY VLADIMIROVICH KOSTIKOV, a KGB officer born in Moscow on March 17, 1933. He was posted to Beirut in 1978 as 1st Secretary and may still be there. He served in Mexico City from 1961-1971. The document references BARRON's "KGB" and EPSTEIN's "Legend," which suggest KOSTIKOV may have been involved in Department V and that he was Lee Harvey OSWALD's KGB case officer in Mexico City. The document explores the possibility of KGB involvement in threats and violence against Western Missions in Beirut, potentially through the Syrians. The author requests information on KOSTIKOV's activities in Mexico and Beirut, confirmation of his current location, and any other individuals in Beirut or Damascus with potential involvement in Active Measures.
