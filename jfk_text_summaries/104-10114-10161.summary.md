This document, dated February 1, 1961, concerns the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE. Michael Stratton (WH/4/Registry) reports to C/EAB/OS, via Mr. Belt and WH/L/Security (ATTN: Mr. Kennedy), that he spent the evening of January 6 with Court Wood, a student recently returned from Cuba under the sponsorship of the FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE. Both Court Wood and his father hold pro-Castro sentiments and are critical of US foreign policy. Stratton was advised by Mr. Dave Phillips (C/WH/4/Propaganda) to continue his relationship with Wood and will keep the office informed. The memo is for informational purposes and to become part of Stratton's security file. The document suggests an operational goal involving Stratton and Wood, despite their different social circles.
