This document summarizes an effort in 1965 to leverage the Information Council of the Americas (INCA), located at 620 Gravier Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, as a source of foreign intelligence on the radio broadcasting industry in Latin America. INCA, led by Executive Vice President and Staff Director Edward Scannell Butler, disseminates anti-Communist "Truth Tapes" to radio stations in Latin America and North America.

The document details the agency's contact with Butler, his cooperation, and the examination of INCA's correspondence with radio stations in 16 Latin American countries. The goal is to gather information on radio stations broadcasting the Truth Tapes, their addresses, key personnel, audience responses, and technical details about the stations' equipment. The agency suggests additional topics for INCA's questionnaire to elicit technical information from the radio stations. The document mentions Dr. Martin Migueo-Narancio in Uruguay as a source of political information on radio personnel in Montevideo. The agency plans to extract information from INCA's files and present it in a series of reports.
