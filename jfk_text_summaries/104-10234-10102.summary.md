This document is a dispatch from the Chief of Station, JMHAVE, to the Deputy Chief, WH/SA, concerning the infiltration of Modesto Orlando Orozco Basulto ("Bebo") into Cuba. It includes a memorandum for ACSI (Army Counterintelligence) in Miami regarding this infiltration.

**Summary:**

The dispatch details the circumstances surrounding Orozco's mission to rescue Jose Vasquez Nerey and others from Havana, Cuba. Orozco's wife, Josefina Lopez Angulo de Orozco, contacted a CAS (Controlled Agent Source) source after her husband disappeared following his departure for Cuba on December 21, 1964. She revealed that Orozco was contacted by a Puerto Rican man named "Jorge" (later identified as "Torres") who told him about Vasquez's plight. Hortensia Orizondo Meneses was Orozco's contact for the Vasquez affair and provided funds for the operation.

Mrs. Orozco expressed suspicion of Gloria Cabrera, at whose house Vasquez was hiding. She also revealed details of the planned infiltration route, contacts in Cuba (Candido Diaz, Pedro Barbi), and communication methods.

A CAS sub-source confirmed Orozco's plans and Orizondo's financial support. Mrs. Orozco later learned of arrests in the area where her husband was to infiltrate. She confronted "Jorge" and Orizondo about this information.

"Jorge" later visited Mrs. Orozco and revealed his real name was "Torres." He claimed his organization was interested in agents hiding with Vasquez, not Vasquez himself. Mrs. Orozco asked "Torres" to help exfiltrate her husband if he was still in hiding or negotiate his release if he was captured, even suggesting she travel to Mexico to plead her husband's case with the President of Mexico.

The dispatch includes notes from Orizondo to Orozco regarding funds and a potential boat contact. CAS requests ACSI comments on the allegations against "Jorge" and Orizondo.
